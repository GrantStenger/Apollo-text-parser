______________________________________________________________________________

PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: So I will you know continue to see you up until that point and before I leave we would set up a
session where you could, you know so introductions could be done.
PATIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: Between you and the new therapist.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: Okay? Any thoughts about that or...?
PATIENT: Well it's sort of unexpected. I've sort of been comfortable talking to you.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I mean I'm sure that there probably wouldn't be that much of a problem.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: It's not like I can't get along with people.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: It's just sort of...I don't know. And unexpected thing I guess.
COUNSELOR: Yeah and it just...
PATIENT: But I mean it's a - stuff happens, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. So I mean I think it would be a good thing to do to continue with the treatment.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And just as you've been open with me, you know I'm sure [indiscernible] favors the same type of,
you know transparency.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: Okay?
PATIENT: Mmm hmm (3:05).
COUNSELOR: Did you have any questions at all or...?
PATIENT: Well I sort of, I was told that this, like after this third meeting I'd sort of know - or we would have a
better idea of what - where to go from here.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Right.
PATIENT: I mean because even though I've sort of been happy coming the ﬁrst two times COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: - like, I still don't feel as if I've actually done anything about my situation.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: About how I'm feeling about myself, how I'm feeling about - just in general.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.

PATIENT: I mean like lately I've just been so busy where I've sort of been distracted from it.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I know that if - the moment I get like any free time I'm just going to go right back to feeling
completely miserable. And just out of it. And I'm worried about that.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: And so I kind of want to know.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Well like I explained to you here before, the ﬁrst three sessions are you know basically
the time where I would have gathered information to get to know you a little bit better and then come up with a
treatment plan of what you know your target areas should be. In our discussions where the treatment should go from
there.
PATIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: And so far what I'm gathering is that you know you have reported some depression.
PATIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: And so that's something that then at least should be a target, us trying to ﬁgure out what are the
roots of your depression of course? And then how to move you out of that state so it doesn't affect your school or
your relationships you know with others and how you feel about yourself.
PATIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: So just thinking there may be some - just from what I've gathered from what you've told me so far,
there may be some unresolved childhood issues. It sounds like in school there was a lot of teasing and taunting.
PATIENT: Mmm hmm (6:08).
COUNSELOR: And so maybe some of that is being carried over in how you see yourself in some instances today.
PATIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: Which could play on your self esteem sometimes. And then this difference, it seems like you have a
different values system from your parents.
PATIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: And I'm wondering if any familial conﬂict is inﬂuencing your mood and the depression as well. It
just seems like you want to go one direction, your parents are trying to get you to go in another direction.
PATIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: So there seems like there's probably some inner conﬂict that you might be experiencing. And how
do we go about getting to a point where you can resolve some of that within yourself. And then the issue that we
talked about last session I believe as far as your social relationships and getting to a place where you say that you
want today or you want, it's been relationships. But that's not happening right now.
PATIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: So exploring you know what that might be about and how do we get you to the point where you can
build those healthy relationships that you're kind of seeking. So those are the things that I'm thinking about. And I
just want to hear your feedback on that, what do you see?
PATIENT: I think a lot of that's really accurate. I mean lately I've just, with the teasing thing I mean I - that was
something that happened to me a lot as a kid.

COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Just because I think I was overly sensitive to it and it bothered me. I mean now I sort of, I try not to stand
out too much as being too weird (9:03).
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Or I mean in certain situations with like people that I - like I'll sort of walk into a room and if it's got new
people there I'll sort of judge the situation based on who I see in the room and how I think people will perceive my
actions.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And I'll act accordingly.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that sort of feels weird because I don't always feel like myself.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, yes, right.
PATIENT: I mean sometimes I don't mind like some of the personas I sort of take on because they are part of
myself.
COUNSELOR: What kind of personas, I'm curious.
PATIENT: Well I mean if I'm sort of hanging out with sort of the more artsy, kind of theater-type kids then I'll be
sort of loud and outgoing and crazy and - and if I'm sort of hanging out with people who are sort of more, I guess for
lack of a better word, like, that I can think of off the top of my head, like more sort of normal, sort of regular people
I sort of act in a more - in a more subdued way. I mean I don't - I mean I'm not ever just quiet.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because that's not really my nature at all. Unless I'm just really out of my element. Then I sort of have a
hard time. Like if I'm the odd man out and everybody in a room knows each other, I'm the only one who doesn't
know anybody.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: That always gets awkward.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: But I mean otherwise like, I'm still me. I'm still sort of an outgoing, talkative type person. But I'll tone
down behaviors and certain things and certain humor type things.
COUNSELOR: I guess I'm wondering Ted as I'm hearing you describe this, I get the picture. You know like a
chameleon, do you ﬁnd yourself being more of a chameleon, adapting to whatever environment (12:12) PATIENT: Yeah. I try to be.
COUNSELOR: - that you're in.
PATIENT: And a lot of the time it's sort of an obnoxious habit of mine too.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Where sometimes like if someone - if I see someone else not really ﬁtting in, like sort of being excessive
in a certain direction. Like, being a little bit out of place.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.

PATIENT: I sort of am like, "Dude, chill out with that." As though I'm like, as though I see myself in that position
because that's sort of where I used to be to a great extent, where I was sort of out of place.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And it's kind of obnoxious to like, tell somebody that they're, like to stop being themselves.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And I mean sometimes it - like even if it's not bothering anybody, I do that sort of thing. But - and I
really hate myself afterward. That - it's just an obnoxious, mean thing to do to tell somebody to stop being
themselves. Particularly when that was something that bothered me as a kid.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: But yeah, I guess the chameleon thing would be - I try to sort of ﬁt whoever I'm with.
COUNSELOR: So who is Ted?
PATIENT: Well there's certain things that are sort of standard. I am a person who talks a lot. I have a lot to say in
general. And I mean generally I'm outgoing. I don't hide things. I don't sort of - I mean, I like to think that I'm an
intelligent person.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Sure.
PATIENT: I like to think that I'm funny and that - that I can be funny in certain situations (15:04). I'm - I mean
internally I'm a very sensitive person. I don't take criticism well. I'm also stubborn as hell.
COUNSELOR: What is an example of not taking criticism well or an example of stubbornness?
PATIENT: Well like my parents, like, for example they tell me that I'm bad at taking notes. Which is kind of true. I
mean like in a lecture or something I'll be sitting there and I'll take notes. But like, I don't, if I'm reading something
for class, I don't take notes.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Which probably isn't a good thing. But I just don't' do it. And they tell me, "You should do it. You should
do it. You should do it." And I say, notes don't work for me. I make up excuses. I tell them that, no, that's not me.
Leave me alone. Let me do my own thing. And that's sort of me not taking criticism well.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean as an actor I sort of can - I can sometimes be obnoxious to work with for a director because, I
mean part of me, I really want to get the character down.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And so I question a lot of the decisions the director is making. Because I don't understand it and I don't
see where the director's coming from or how it ﬁts. And if I don't understand the character I don't feel like I can play
the character properly.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So it's sort of, I don't know. That's something that, like I have a hard time taking criticism in that regard.
COUNSELOR: Okay. How do you typically respond to criticism?
PATIENT: I just usually don't listen to it. Or I'll continue doing what I've been doing or even do it to a greater degree
just to spite whoever it is that is giving that criticism (18:02). Sometimes I get mad. And get confrontational.
COUNSELOR: What does it look like when you're mad?

PATIENT: Just start - I mean I don't ﬂip out. I don't go out of control or anything like that I just talk back. I start
being sort of more biting and sarcastic in my comments and COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Sometimes it's my, like with my dad especially because we're both very stubborn people it just devolves
into a yelling match.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Is that typical of you and your father's relationship?
PATIENT: Generally we have a good relationship. I mean basically whenever school or something like that isn't
involved, like a responsibility thing. Because I think he sees me as very irresponsible and just lazy.
COUNSELOR: Mmm.
PATIENT: And I don't know to what degree that's him just being wrong and not knowing me very well and to what
degree - I mean basically when we're not yelling at each other our relationship is great. And we get along very well.
And I have an easier time talking to my dad about things than my mom.
COUNSELOR: Oh, really?
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Just because like my mother, she's just got this very one track mind and always brings everything back to
things and I just - she nags.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I love my mother dearly but she nags.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Constantly. Always harping on things. She - in a ﬁve minute conversation she'll tell me everything that I
need to do that day four or ﬁve times. And it just gets frustrating. And so I don't even bother talking to her because
like, when I start talking to her she just starts going back to school and things that I need to do and just ignore the
other things.
COUNSELOR: Okay (20:58). So you don't feel like you're heard as much or listened to as much by your mother?
PATIENT: Kind of. Yeah. Kind of. I mean she stands up for me when my dad - like in arguments with my dad, when
I argue with him, like she'll stand up for me. But I mean other times it's just hard to sort of, like talking like a career
discussion with my mother.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Is so hard. Because she's so - she always brings up - I mean by now it's sort of turned into like a joke. But
she, basically my mother still pretty much just wants me to be a doctor. And I've not had any interest in science
since middle school.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And she keeps bringing it up. Like, "Maybe you'll think about medical school." And I'm like, "No. Leave
me alone. Stop talking about it."
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Because it's not going to happen. I'm not interested in medicine. It's not my thing.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.

PATIENT: And I mean she keeps bringing it up as a joke but like, it's one of those things that like I can't really talk
to her about what I want to do with my life.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: Because she always brings it back to that. I mean talking about girls and being lonely. She's like well,
you don't have time to focus on that, you have to focus on school.
COUNSELOR: Instead of focusing on what it feels like for you to be lonely and...
PATIENT: Yeah, like, it - I mean it - feelings don't really matter I guess. Or I mean they do but only as sort of a
peripheral thing.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: The most important thing is school over work or that sort of thing. And everything else is just sort of like
yeah, it's better to be happy than be sad but deal with it. If it interferes with school then we'll deal with it. And that's
the only reason why I'm here I think (24:02). Why they suggested for me to be here because I was failing at school.
COUNSELOR: Right. And so it's like PATIENT: It was affecting my school and that was not something that she could stand for. I mean if I had been
getting As but still been completely miserable, the only thing that would've gotten her to get me into therapy would
have been if I had tried to kill myself.
COUNSELOR: At one point you mentioned you cut your arm, and nothing was done about that?
PATIENT: Not a thing.
COUNSELOR: There was no investigation or...
PATIENT: Well what happened was I mean I never was, when I was cutting myself in high school it was never a
suicide thing.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: It was always the side of the arm, all down. And one time she just found like a couple cuts on my arm
and she was just like oh, it's - you just got really stressed out and you just did it and it's a one time thing. And she
just left it at that.
COUNSELOR: And so let me ask you this Ted, how would you ideally like your mom or your dad to approach your
feelings or react to these type of situations? Other, I mean instead of, you know, getting involved unless it's affecting
your schoolwork. Instead of them or your mom minimizing your feelings or not validating them, how would you
want them to respond?
PATIENT: Well...I mean...I...like...I just want less stress from them, you know? Less pressure (27:02). More than
anything else. I mean because it's such an - it's a really intense push towards what they see as success. And I just
sort of wish they were more understanding of, of the fact that I just, I'm not interested in the same thing. I don't see
success as getting the best grades in school.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And my mother was like that as a girl. Like she was always competing with her friends to see who could
get the highest grade point average. And I don't care. I like getting As, sure. I'd much rather get As than Bs. And
much rather get Bs than Cs and so on and so forth. But I don't care how other people are doing.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Because I'm not competing against them.
COUNSELOR: Sure.

PATIENT: At least not in my mind. And it's just frustrating that I'm being forced to compete with everybody.
COUNSELOR: I can see how that could be frustrating.
PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know, my dad also - the biggest thing, I just wish he would stop to think about things once
in awhile. Because he just sort of - a lot of the time he just sort of ﬂies off the handle without - he's stubborn and he
has a short temper.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I mean just sort of like an example, this is something minor but like, it was a regular occurrence in high
school where if I was working on a paper, and it was like a book report kind of thing, I'd be reading the book.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: While the paper was on the screen. He'd walk by my room, see me not actively typing, and just start
yelling at me (29:59). And I said, Dad, I'm writing a book report. I need to read the book. I need to actually be
knowing what I'm writing about before I can do it. And this completely didn't matter. Because he didn't want - he
didn't stop and think oh, he's writing a book report.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: He's reading the book he's writing about. He's doing what he's supposed to be doing. Leave the kid alone.
It just didn't register until I ﬁnally just yelled at him and just said, look! I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing!
This is for my paper!
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And that was a common occurrence. I mean he makes an assumption and ﬂies off the handle.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. So again it's about getting to know - it's not - I hear you saying you would like your
parents to get to know you better rather than making assumptions about PATIENT: They know me COUNSELOR: - who you are and what you're doing....
PATIENT: They know me fairly well. But they COUNSELOR: But what about the important things that you want to PATIENT: - don't. It's like - yeah. It's - they don't, I think they just see certain traits as more important than others
that I don't - that I disagree with. That I don't see those as the most important traits.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I mean they see me as intelligent. Therefore I should be getting all As. But I'm not - I don't have the drive
to be competing with people. Because that doesn't drive me.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: But they respond with, "Well, it should." Well that's great but it doesn't.
COUNSELOR: That's not you PATIENT: Yeah. It's not me and I'm not - I don't think that I'm - I think that they love me dearly and they wouldn't
trade me for anybody.
COUNSELOR: Sure, sure.
PATIENT: But they don't want me to be - they want me to be Me 2.0.

COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: You know? Like a better, improved version.
COUNSELOR: Is that a tough measure to, stick to measure yourself against (33:07)?
PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it's very tough. Also tough because I mean my brother's very successful.
COUNSELOR: And that's the one thing PATIENT: Incredibly successful. And he's very driven and he's all these things - like my mom wanted a lawyer and
a doctor. And she's got herself an economist now. She's not going to get her doctor. And like nobody in my family
acknowledges it. My brother doesn't acknowledge it and my parents don't acknowledge it. But all the time whether
they acknowledge it or not I feel like I'm being compared to him.
COUNSELOR: Have you - do you see yourself as living in his shadow?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I went to the same high school he did.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I applied to the same colleges he did - not entirely, but basically. I mean my ﬁrst choice was Loyola
University, that's where he went and that's where he got a full scholarship to. I didn't. I got in but I didn't get the full
scholarship that he got.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And I was expected to apply to Harvard. And I didn't want to. That was his school of choice.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's where he wanted to go.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And that's where he went for economy school. But like I didn't want to go. I was not interested in that
place. And I mean I sort of feel like it's a disappointment that I'm at the EMU.
COUNSELOR: Really? Disappointment?
PATIENT: Yeah. Because when I was a little kid my parents were always threatening me that if I didn't do well in
school I'd be going to EMU.
COUNSELOR: Right so it's just like PATIENT: There's a point of - and then ﬁnally when they realized that there was no way they'd be able to pay for
Loyola, they changed their tune. And were like, "Oh, it's a very good school." And I got a scholarship here. "Oh,
that's great, that's fantastic. Bud didn't get that kind of scholarship." But he got a better one to a school that they saw
as better.
COUNSELOR: Do you think that you are a disappointment to your parents or your family (36:07)?
PATIENT: To a certain extent. And I don't think they admit it. I don't think they realize it.
COUNSELOR: They don't realize what?
PATIENT: That I'm - that they see me in this - or that they treat me in this way, rather.
COUNSELOR: Okay. So there's a difference PATIENT: It's not measuring up to their http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:4832/psyc/psyc.object.details.aspx?dorpID=1000094445

9/24

COUNSELOR: There's a difference between your feeling like you're a disappointment and them treating you like a
disappointment.
PATIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: Do you - are there - are both of them occurring at the same time or....
PATIENT: Well I'm feeling like they treat me like a disappointment because they're treating me as a disappointment.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because I can see that they want me to be something that I'm not.
COUNSELOR: Right. Because you're not a doctor.
PATIENT: It seems like a sign of a ﬂaw if they are trying to tell me to be something else. But - I don't know. That
seems like COUNSELOR: What does that feel like for you Ted?
PATIENT: Maybe that's one of the things that's contributing to my depression. I mean I certainly never feel like I'm
good enough for anything.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: When I think about it and when I talk about it like, so blatantly, I mean it doesn't - it by itself doesn't
make me feel sad. I've sort of gotten used to it. Which that actually makes me feel more sad than anything else.
COUNSELOR: That you've gotten used to it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Can you take a moment and think back to a time when you ﬁrst were experiencing it and hadn't
gotten used to it?
PATIENT: I guess middle school. I mean I just sort of wasn't doing all of my work and (39:00)...
COUNSELOR: What did that point feel like, before you [indiscernible].
PATIENT: That part, that, I mean middle school was just a bad time in general because I mean I was just ﬁnally sort
of getting over - like, ﬁguring out social situations.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: But I was sort of doomed because I was going to private school and everybody else I knew was going to
public school. And that was set in stone. So that was sort of just awkward. I mean as sort of picking up skills when it
came to sort of communicating with people in general.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: And getting along with people in general. And not being so - so, like soft-skinned and whatnot. Or thinskinned. I guess. Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You would express your feelings equally.
PATIENT: Yeah. Like I wasn't so - I was able - like I was ﬁguring out a bit of defenses. But at the same time I just
didn't care about school.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.

PATIENT: And it wasn't a depression thing, it wasn't anything like that, it was that I just didn't care. Because
everything I was doing was just inane and pointless.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Particularly in eighth grade. In - I had a science class - it was particularly in one class. It was a science
class. Where I was just so bored by what the teacher - like we were doing an "experiment" where we were chewing
gum for the class period.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: In eighth - as 14-year olds, or 13-year olds. Which is just absurd. I mean at that point I was just so turned
off by the whole thing that I just didn't do any of my work. And then when - then basically I, because my parents
expected me to do really well and I wasn't doing well because I wasn't putting any effort in, like there was this
expectation and I just didn't want to let them down. And I - so I sort of would lie to them. I would just outright lie to
them and say, "Everything's ﬁne. Nothing's wrong (42:03)."
COUNSELOR: Kind of like what happened last year I guess.
PATIENT: Yeah. I mean it's sort of still the same pattern. Because I'm still trying to break that pattern of lying to
them all the time.
COUNSELOR: But you feel as though you have to in order to PATIENT: Yeah. In order to just get them off my back. Like now it's not even to make them proud of me. Now it's
just to get them to leave me alone about it.
COUNSELOR: So at one point it was to try and seek their approval or...
PATIENT: Yeah. And - or rather not have them disappointed in me.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: And now I sort of already know that they're disappointed in me and...
COUNSELOR: Have you ever shared that with them?
PATIENT: Yeah. They accuse me of trying to put the blame on them. And said that they weren't going to stand for it.
COUNSELOR: So no taking responsibility for maybe why you're feeling this way or their part, the part they could
have played in what's going on?
PATIENT: I don't think they feel responsible.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I think they - if I were to sit - I mean anytime I've even hinted at that they've sort of just told me to stop
passing off the blame onto them and just do what I'm supposed to do.
COUNSELOR: So how do you work on that? How do you make sense of that? How do you...
PATIENT: It doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to me. And I try not to think about it because COUNSELOR: How do you feel about it?
PATIENT: It's kind of obnoxious, actually. Like they tell me to take responsibility for my own prob - for my own
problems and yet I sort of feel like they're not taking responsibility for their own problems. And COUNSELOR: They must not realize the amount of pressure that they're placing on you (45:05).

PATIENT: They know that they're hard on me but they don't know - I don't think they realize how much it affects
me.
COUNSELOR: That it affects you.
PATIENT: They just think that it makes me - that I'm just lazy and that I'm just sort of ignoring them and getting
mad at them and that I have no right to do that. That it's just me being lazy and that's why they're hard on me. And
they've been hard on me all my life.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: So I don't see how it's my fault. They're the ones raising me after all. Or who raised me I guess. So it's
sort of absurd to say that they don't have any responsibility for how I turn out.
COUNSELOR: Is there anyone in your life or in your circle who you feel understands you or gets where you're
coming from or...anyone who validates your feelings?
PATIENT: Sometimes. I have a really good friend, I think I've talked about her already, where there's sort of like a
romantic thing COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: - that is all very ambiguous and didn't make any sense and wound up just falling apart. Sometimes she
really gets me.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And just really understands me and then sometimes she just - it's impossible to talk to her. And I don't
know...
COUNSELOR: So that has to be a tough spot to be in. You know it's kind of like you're speaking English and you
know no one is responding to what you're saying. And you know you're speaking English, you know you're
speaking it clearly and still people don't - they act like you're speaking Martian or you know - but it's even more so
the case, I mean it can be something that can hurt you when you're talking about your own feelings (48:15). And
something as important as your dreams or your goals or what's important to you. And to not have that validated or
acknowledged and to feel as though you have to go through life changing to ﬁt other peoples' needs or just to be
accepted or just to be acknowledged or to be praised or whatever the case is, that would kind of be a tough life to
lead.
PATIENT: Yeah. It's - it's not very, very easy or pleasant I guess. I mean if it was easy and pleasant I wouldn't be
here.
COUNSELOR: Right. That's right.
PATIENT: I don't know. It's - it's kind of hard just because I mean everyone's sort of caught up in their own things
too.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: You know? It's hard to have - it's hard to make people care about someone other than themselves.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: And - I don't know.
COUNSELOR: I think that's what's so awesome Ted, I remember back to I think one of our ﬁrst or second sessions
you talk about the type of work you would like to do as far as the missions work or working with the orphans. And
so it takes a special type of person to not get so caught up in their own life and what's going on to them. You know
and still be able to lend their hand to someone else or to be about someone else's life. And so for you to still have a
part of yourself that you want to give to others in spite of all these challenges that you're facing, I think that shows a
certain strength of you (51:05).

PATIENT: Mmm hmm. I mean generally I like helping other people. I mean sometimes I'm just at my happiest
when I've - when I've helped somebody else.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: I mean even in just some little, minor, stupid way.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Like if I'm standing at Taco Bell and some - on a Saturday night and some drunk guy comes in and is
like, "Eh, can I borrow a smoke off of anybody?" And if I have a cigarette and I just give the guy a smoke, it's like
take it, whatever. Like that - even something small like that.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I mean I don't really care that much about money. I just don't. You know? I'm happier giving it to
somebody else, lending it or giving it to somebody else to help them with a need or something like that than
spending it on something stupid for myself. I mean like just the other night I was just feeling kind of down and a
friend of mine was just walking by eating like a speciﬁc brand of chips. And I went to the, like the store in south
quad and just bought a pack and like, I bought a couple other things for myself, but I bought that because I still had
like a dollar in like my meal credit thing.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And was like, why not? Sure. And then I just gave it to her. Because she really liked them and whatever,
you know? Like I didn't - wasn't going to use the dollar, I didn't see anything wrong with that. Like it seems like in
that sort of a situation from like my parents' perspective, they would have - they would have wanted me to spend the
dollar on myself or save the dollar if at all possible. Or something. Or not spend any money at all (54:00).
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And I just don't care. You know? I mean I want to do sort of - the reason, even, despite the fact that I'm
not Christian, despite the fact that I'm very into girls, less so now I guess than I was because I just sort of shut down
that part of my body lately.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: But I - I still want to become a priest. A Catholic speciﬁcally because of the work they do helping other
people. And because like I just remove that aspect of my life. Just get rid of the monetary issues entirely. Because
everything is communal.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I mean my salary would just go right to the community. I would be spending community money to buy
clothes and food and whatnot that all comes from the community.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: So I don't feel like I would have a problem with that, you know?
COUNSELOR: How do you - could that be some type of metaphor or symbolism for how you may have wanted
your own family to operate or function in some sense?
PATIENT: It's possible. It's possible that that's why I sort of look at that as an option for myself. And just - I mean I
always get drawn to groups that call themselves families where we're always going to be friends and it never works.
And I've sort of become jaded by it since then. But a lot of the time I was in theater groups and things like that
where everyone's like oh, we're such a family. And then you ﬁnally realize that that's complete nonsense. That a
family acts a certain way and a group of kids acts another (57:01). And - but like I guess that's been a big search of
mine, I guess or goal of mine. To ﬁnd sort of a place where I belong.

COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Yeah because it doesn't seem like you feel as though you belong as much in your own
family.
PATIENT: It's - I feel like I'm sort of giving off the wrong impression of my family.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean I really do love them and I know that they love me.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: And that - and we tell each other that all the time.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And we know that we're not lying to each other about that.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: But like yeah, sometimes I feel out of place. I mean everybody sort of feels out of place.
COUNSELOR: And you know what Ted, just because sometimes you feel out of place it doesn't...
PATIENT: It doesn't mean I don't belong to the family.
COUNSELOR: It doesn't mean that you don't belong to the family. It doesn't believe - it doesn't mean that you love
them any less.
PATIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: You know. But you don't have to go [indiscernible] and you can still love them. They can still love
you. You can still be a part of the family. But then at times as you say there are a lot of ﬂex.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You know when I look at you and the - some things that you've talked about as far as, it seems like
you have a difﬁcult time setting goals for yourself or future plans, because what happens if I don't meet them. I
think that's what you made reference to in one session. And it's kind of like if you don't have that basic need - have
you heard of Maslow [ph] before? He was a behaviorist.
PATIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: And he had - he has this hierarchy of needs. And there are certain basic needs that all humans have.
PATIENT: Oh, I've heard of the hierarchy. I didn't know the name (60:00).
COUNSELOR: Right. So it's Maslow's [ph] hierarchy and here you've got the food, water, just basic safety you
know those sorts of things. But then there's a sense of belonging is a need. And then it goes up into more, you know
increased type of things you may need like esteem and self-regard or regard, to feel regarded. But the sense of
belonging is one of the basic needs. And so if you don't feel as though you belong somewhere or someplace or to
somebody then it doesn't - these other things won't be able to fall into place. You know? So if you're in a position
where you don't feel as though you belong then how can you have these future goals and future plans? These sorts
of things that these basic things aren't being taken care of. You know? And so that's real. And I can understand why
you might sometimes feel out of place. Here they have a certain measuring stick because you have this big brother,
you have your family who's immigrated you know and they've accomplished certain things. And you know and then
they hold you to these certain expectations. It doesn't mean that you can't reach these expectations, they're just not
things that you're interested in. So it doesn't make you any less of a person but yet if you're not meeting them then
you feel as though you're a disappointment and they make you feel like you're a disappointment. And you know you
seem very different philosophy, view of life than you know where they might be coming from. So it's like do I really
ﬁt into this? And on some level you're thinking I should be - I should ﬁt into, this is my family, these are my parents,
this is my brother. I should be connected to them but then I feel - just look at the reality of things.

PATIENT: I mean sometimes like I really do feel connected to them a lot. Like my brother asked me to be the best
man at his wedding.
COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.
PATIENT: And that just made me so happy (63:07).
COUNSELOR: Sure. Tell me about that. What about that makes you so happy?
PATIENT: Just, I mean it's such a huge honor you know that my brother would pick me over like his best friend,
over - I mean so - like he knows a lot of people from college and grad school that he gets along with really well and
he's really good friends with and yet he still picked me.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: And I mean, it's just, it's such a huge honor for me. And it really makes me feel like - I mean because my
brother's always sort of been the most aloof member of my family. Sort of - I mean the least likely to say, "I love
you." That kind of thing. And just to hear him say that and ask me to be his best man is just - it really just means a
lot.
COUNSELOR: How did he present it to you? How did he ask you?
PATIENT: Well, he - it's sort of when he told me that he was getting married. I was actually the ﬁrst person he - I
mean ﬁrst of all he didn't tell anybody before he got engaged. The ﬁrst person who found out that they were getting
married was his ﬁanc�e when he proposed.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I mean I guess the person that he bought the ring from. But I mean I was literally - it was this summer
that I found out. I was literally at the line at the airport to go to Croatia for seven weeks.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And I had talked to him not two hours before.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Because he had called to like say goodbye and that kind of thing. Hope you have fun in Croatia. I was
standing in line at the airport to get my ticket and I get a call and he says, "Hey buddy, I'm getting engaged (66:05)."
And I - ﬁrst of all I thought he was joking.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because he does that a lot, he's used me for practical jokes on his friends.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: He convinced one of his friends that I was adopted from China. She had never met me and so it worked
out. And it was one of those things where like he had me call him.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And like, said hey, wait, talk to my friend Jennifer. And she was just like, Bud tells me that you're....And
I was like, "Yeah, adopted. I was adopted at the age of two." And he just came up with this really elaborate story.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And so I thought that's what he was doing to me. He was telling me he was getting married to mess with
me. And then he - and I just couldn't believe it for ﬁve minutes and was just like, are you kidding me? Now
seriously don't joke about this. This is really serious.

COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Just - and then sort of as - like after I ﬁnally believed him he was just like yeah, and if we do this sort of
thing, will you be my best man? And I was just blown away by that.
COUNSELOR: Being there in line at the airport, and...
PATIENT: Yeah. Just blown away by that.
COUNSELOR: Why? Why would you have been so blown away?
PATIENT: Because I mean it's just, it's the sort of thing that my brother - that tells me just how much I mean to my
brother.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: You know?
COUNSELOR: Did you question that at some point?
PATIENT: Well I mean, when I was little I mean my brother just, we would always ﬁght.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I mean he's ﬁve and a half years older than me but he would still just beat me up every day.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: He actually broke my arm one time on accident. It wasn't an accident, it was actually more my fault than
his.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I mean that was the relationship we had (69:00). It was always very sort of confrontational. Not - I
mean in a more sort of playful sort of way. It wasn't like actually trying to hurt each other or anything.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But it was very physical, almost violent - I guess it was violent but not like in the sort of negative
connotation way. That was the sort of relationship that we had. And so I always sort of saw myself as the annoying
little brother.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And I mean since he moved away to college and then past that I mean, he's really matured in some
respects and particularly like with the relationship that we have. And so I mean I just, I don't know. It's just a very
big thing and I didn't think that he would ask me to be his best man.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Well that had to be afﬁrming.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Has your relationship with your brother changed since this?
PATIENT: Since he asked me to be his best man?
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Not in any real noticeable way. But I mean it's - it was sort of like a ﬁnal validation kind of thing that this
was really how he felt about me as his brother. And I mean for the past couple years he's been very cool, very - I
mean we've been very close.

COUNSELOR: What does he think about you being in therapy? Does he know?
PATIENT: He's really worried about me. And I can tell. I mean when it ﬁrst sort of came out that I was - this year,
that I was sort of screwing my life up again he called me and I mean, started yelling at me. Not yelling like, you're
an idiot, I can't stand you, that sort of thing. But I mean he's just like why? What are you doing? Why are you doing
this? Because he was just panicking and he was just so worried about me that - and he just didn't understand (72:14).
Like he was - it was actually very frustrating to have a conversation with him because he was asking me questions
that if I knew the answer then I wouldn't be in the situation that I was in.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: Like why am I screwing up everything? Well I don't know.
COUNSELOR: I'm wondering Ted - it sounds like two things are coming to me you know as you ask that question.
One is you know sometimes [audio gap] things in a way. You know want to ask for things that we're not getting.
Another reason could be to, I don't want to use the word "bail" but - I'd use that and then come up with another word
for it. Where we bail against something that someone has put on us that we really don't want to do. You know so I'm
wondering - I'm wondering what you think about that? Or what do you - if this was someone else kind of leading
this pattern what do you think would be going on?
PATIENT: It certainly makes sense on a fundamental level. I mean I don't know to what extent it's me rebelling
outright.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I sort of feel like it's more the ﬁrst thing than the second thing.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um...
COUNSELOR: Because it's interesting...
PATIENT: Yeah (75:06).
COUNSELOR: It's interesting how I go back to this time in your life when you're cutting on your arms, right? And
this could have been a way of you trying to ask for something that you weren't getting from PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: You know expressing something that - and it wasn't validated, it wasn't acknowledged. It wasn't you weren't heard, any sorts of thing so that didn't matter. And you said earlier that it only matters to your family
when school is involved. Right? So now you're not cutting on your arms but you're doing something in school to
cause concern. And maybe this will get their attention ﬁnally?
PATIENT: Maybe. I mean I've never thought about it like that. I've never thought well, I'm not going to go to class
because that'll COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: - teach them or anything like that. It sounds very plausible that that's what it is. I mean...
COUNSELOR: And it may not be rebelling. Like it may not be that.
PATIENT: Yeah. Or but I mean just like, they're not helping me so I'll just stop going to class. I mean thinking about
it in those sorts of terms it's sort of - that just sounds sort of stupid. You're just hurting yourself to get their attention.
Why?
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: But I mean I don't really have any explanation for why I sort of stopped going or don't care.

COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Or sort of lack any real motivation for doing those things.
COUNSELOR: And I'm sure you understand how unconscious works.
PATIENT: Well, sort of. I mean not entirely. I don't - I haven't taken any real psych classes yet and I actually want to
sign up for one (78:03).
COUNSELOR: Well sometimes what happens is that like you said you don't consciously think of it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: But if you did it would be like why would you do that? You're hurting yourself and you know,
parents really aren't being affected by it one way or another. It's really you that is hindering your own progress. But
sometimes we express our unconscious wishes and desires in ways that are most, you know adaptive to us without
knowing and without being conscious of it. You know so our unconscious wishes and desires come in our behaviors
and how we interact with people or the choices that we make in the situations that we set up. And sometimes it's
even a repetition of past things, unresolved past issues that we may have there. You know? So it's just something for
you to begin thinking about. How could this be you know me really wanting ﬁnally help from my parents? Or them
to ﬁnally acknowledge me and my feelings? You know? Because to not - to sit down with your mother, about people
you think about the stereotypes of what a mother is, to be able to sit down in a situation and say mom, I'm lonely. I
want a girlfriend. And she tells you well, whatever, school is more important. You think you'd be able to talk about
something that's sensitive as a man with your mother. But to not have that validated or heard or understood is like
how can I get her to understand and really help me or see me - you know so if I can't talk to her what will grab her
attention?
PATIENT: Yeah. Lately I've just also been sort of a lot more pessimistic and cynical (81:07).
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I think I mentioned it a little bit earlier but like, I was talking to my friend about it. I mean he - we were
sort of sitting in the lunchroom and he saw a girl that he thought was attractive walk by and he was like, "Wow, she's
a really attractive girl." And I was like, "eh." He's like "What, you don't think she is?" And I was like, "Yeah, but
who cares?" That's just sort of been my sort of feeling lately, that it's like yeah, she's an attractive girl. Whatever.
COUNSELOR: Why do you think you take that sort of approach?
PATIENT: Just bad luck and just such a long dry spell that I just stopped caring.
COUNSELOR: You thinking that it's related to the depression?
PATIENT: Probably. Probably. I mean I just don't care sometimes. I mean I feel like at this point I've just been so
unlucky that it's not even worth pursuing anymore. I've just been shot down so many times or rejected or things just
haven't worked out in a good way that I just...
COUNSELOR: Have you done any reﬂection on what might not have PATIENT: I have but I haven't come up with any good answers. Or any - I haven't found any better understanding of
the situations.
COUNSELOR: Are there certain patterns that you're noticing in your relationships?
PATIENT: I think part of it's I just - I'm attracted to, like right now it sounds really cynical and horrible to say but
like, I feel like I'm attracted to people who are just well outside of my league.
COUNSELOR: Mmm. What does it mean to be well outside of your league (84:06)?
PATIENT: Well like people who just wouldn't ﬁnd me physically attractive. Or something like that. I mean it's sort
of like - as to sort of exaggerate it to an extreme, it would be like the 45-year old unemployed, balding and
overweight guy asking out a supermodel. It's just not going to happen.

PATIENT: Well I just sort of feel like I'm just not that good looking or attractive or really there'd be any reason for
anybody to like me. And I keep ﬁnding myself attracted to girls who I feel are much better looking relatively than I
am. And just on a different level I guess.
COUNSELOR: How do you assess them, like how, what measuring stick or how do you...?
PATIENT: Nothing formal or anything like that.
COUNSELOR: How society looks at this particular young woman they would say that? Or how other people PATIENT: No, I think it's more of just like I feel like they deserve better than me. Better looking COUNSELOR: Has any of the girls told you that or...?
PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: Is there anything...?
PATIENT: I've just been rejected so many times and like I've pursued girls who just haven't been interested at all.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That just not working.
COUNSELOR: How does it feel to be rejected?
PATIENT: It feels pretty terrible. It's a very, very horrible feeling (87:04).
COUNSELOR: I can imagine.
PATIENT: And I think that's why I just sort of don't care anymore. Because it's better - I hate being rejected.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I have such a huge fear of rejection. It's why - I mean I'm a coward, really when it comes to women.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: There was a girl that I was attracted to earlier this year for - I was attracted to her for like six months
before I actually had said anything. Because I was just terriﬁed that she was going to reject me. And she did. She did
reject me. But...
COUNSELOR: What did she say?
PATIENT: Well, the whole situation was sort of ridiculous. I basically had, on one of my very rare occasions I had
gotten drunk because when if ever I drink, I don't drink to get drunk at all. But I was - this was like the one time in
the last two years that I've actually been drunk. And I guess I said something like, I like you or something like that
over the phone to her. And the next day she was sort of, "Look we need to talk" and I was like, "Okay well, what's
up?" Or maybe it was something like "I have a record that I called you. Did I say anything embarrassing last night?"
And she's, "Okay we need to talk. Can we meet for coffee?" And we met and she was just like, "Look, Ted, I'm
sorry. This is what you said. I'm sorry, I'm not interested."
COUNSELOR: Did she say anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. That was sort of the end of it. No real reason why.

(90:00).
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: She just wasn't into me.

PATIENT: August? It was over the summer [indiscernible]. But just as I was going to say something I found out that
she had a boyfriend.
COUNSELOR: Oh.
PATIENT: And not just like, oh, some guy that I started dating before I left. It was a guy I've been dating for three
years.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: And also I could just sort of tell that she wasn't interested. I mean there was no reason to be interested.
COUNSELOR: There's no reason to be interested?
PATIENT: Well because, because she had a boyfriend.
COUNSELOR: Oh.
PATIENT: And someone that she really cared about. I don't know. I'm not very good at - I'm very good at reading
the opposite gender when it's about somebody else. Like I can - if I'm sort of set - removed from the situation I can
see when two people really like each other.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And really want to have a relationship together. Even if they don't see it. But I can't tell at all with myself
when I'm involved in the situation. Because sometimes I sense like a mutual attraction - completely wrong. And
sometimes I sort of wake up the next day and realize that, wait a minute, I'm in a relationship now. Wait, was I
there? Because every relationship that I've ever, like every sort of boyfriend/girlfriend relationship I've ever been in,
I was sort of told that I was, basically that person told me that I was their boyfriend (93:14).
COUNSELOR: Hmm. So then it's not something that you're doing or initiating.
PATIENT: No. It was just sort of, they were just like, you're my boyfriend now. And I was like, all right. I mean
obviously I'm exaggerating but it was something that I was just sort of thrown - that I was sort of thrown into

PATIENT: I mean I do have, I do have, I feel more control in that - with my parents situation. Because I'm not going
to take a science class. They want me to take pre-med classes. I'm not going to do it.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Nothing they can say is going to change that. So I'm not going to do it. And I mean there have been a
couple times when a girl has said that she had feelings for me and I was just like um, I'm sorry?
COUNSELOR: And you weren't interested.
PATIENT: And I wasn't interested.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I mean the vast majority of the time I was just sort of told that I was going to - I was sort of told,
okay. And I didn't really have any objection to it.
COUNSELOR: I'm curious - we have to wrap it up now. I'm curious to hear more about where you see you know
how this fear of rejection developed. And when do you remember feeling that way and how does that contribute to
the depressive symptoms.
PATIENT: Yeah. I also kind of want to know what's next (96:02).
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: In terms of therapy and - or, I mean, whatever. I don't know.
COUNSELOR: Well what's next is I write up a consult report based on information that you've given me. And in
that report it's kind of to what's your social history and then come up with the goals that I believe you're - that you
want to work on.
PATIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: So those are the things that I mentioned earlier.
PATIENT: Do you think I need to see a psychiatrist or...?
COUNSELOR: I'm wondering, I mean this is an option that you can explore if you think medication will be
beneﬁcial or if you want to try talk therapy ﬁrst to deal with the depression or if you think medication will be
helpful. And I can make a referral.
PATIENT: I mean I don't really know enough about medication to know if it would be helpful or not. So...
COUNSELOR: Well it depends on where the medication, there are different - there are different medications to treat
depression. And so what the medications could do is to help lift your moods, to help you, you know feel more
motivated, not as lethargic or you know unmotivated. It could help, it does something with the chemicals in your
body to help boost your level of energy and your mood and things. So that could help you feel better in a sense. So
maybe if you feel better whether it's chemically induced you know then maybe that can help you perform better.
And so usually depression is treated, you know with a combination of talk therapy for cognitive, you know
behavioral type of things and you know medication.
PATIENT: Mmm hmm.

COUNSELOR: But not everyone takes medication for it (99:01). And so the thing to do is to have the psychiatrist
evaluate you to see if you know he believes that you really need you know medication. So I can you know make a
referral and have them do an evaluation if that's something you're interested in.
PATIENT: Yeah, probably.
COUNSELOR: Have you ever been on medication before?
PATIENT: Not any kind of like steady thing. I mean I take Tylenol - I take Advil if I have a headache. And I take
like Sudafed if I have a cold.
COUNSELOR: Okay, but not any you know psychotropic medication or anything.
PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Yeah. So that's something you can be evaluated for and the doctor, the psychiatrist will
recommend you know whatever medication and whatever dosage. And you can do it in combination with the
therapy. Because I do think you know there are some - the amount of pressure that you're experiencing, the
loneliness as far as the reality of not having you know a fulﬁlling, satisfying relationship, then just not knowing you
know what to do with your life and the you know conﬂict that that poses for you. You know I think this - there's
some practical things that you can work on treatment to help you get a handle on those things. Because maybe it's
about reviewing your history of relationships and maybe looking for patterns of maybe why these things don't work
you know out. Maybe trying some new tactics in approaching you know females or whatever the case is. Then
looking at your thought patterns as far as maybe what sets you up for failure in you know relationships. You know
those sorts of things, are there certain messages that you send to yourself that you know cause you to feel defeated
in that area? And is there some refrainment we can do (102:01). Then going back and looking at how some of these
childhood issues, whether it's you know relationships you had at school or the taunting and teasing, how that may
still, threads of that may still be affecting you know your self esteem, where you don't have the courage to you know
initiate certain relationships. Then when I say fear of rejection, have you experienced that at all you know in your
childhood? And the experience of rejection and how that may be setting you up to fear it even now so you don't take
certain risks. And so maybe some of those things can be resolved so that you can take more risks now.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You know so that's you know kind of what happens now. You know so we come up with a treatment
plan and then we work on those goals.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: So would you want me to refer you for a psych evaluation?
PATIENT: That would probably be best.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean at least just for the evaluation to see if I actually need COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: - anything.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Because that would deﬁnitely help you in the meantime when you're sorting out the
rest of it. You know and I think Ted a part of talk therapy is hopefully experiencing the afﬁrmation and the
validation that you're probably looking for. To ﬁnally sit down with someone who you know makes a good attempt
to understand you. To listen to you without judgment, without condemnation, without you know making you feel
less than or making you conform to their own ideas and philosophies. So maybe just going through that process and
that type of environment can help you in a sense (105:05).
PATIENT: You know it's kind of funny because like the - after like the ﬁrst meeting, because I wanted to sort of deal
with this situation as soon as I could.

COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I also went to CAPS [ph] in the Union and the guy there just basically, it seemed like all he wanted to
know was my sleeping patterns.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And how, how to sort of ﬁx that.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: He didn't care about anything else. He didn't care about my weird eating schedule, he didn't care about
my depression at all. He asked me one question about my depression.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: In the entire hour long visit. And I just felt - was so angry leaving there that I just was like, I'm not going
back.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And I'm really glad that that hasn't - that I actually felt comfortable here.
COUNSELOR: Well good.
PATIENT: With that. Is there any chance that you could also write me up like a note or something?
COUNSELOR: Okay, what kind of note?
PATIENT: Well because basically I need - because from the ﬁrst part of the semester I missed quite a bit for psych
reasons. I mean I just wasn't going to class and they told me that I needed a note from CAPS [ph] or the equivalent
saying there's been some situation - in order to actually get credit for make-up assignments and things like that. To
get some sort of...
COUNSELOR: Okay. Who would I address the note to or...?
PATIENT: Well particularly there are two people. I don't know if there's actually a form I need to get ﬁlled out or
not.
COUNSELOR: Why don't you ﬁnd that out?
PATIENT: Are you going to be here during the week? Like tomorrow at all?
COUNSELOR: I'll be - I won't be here tomorrow but the next time I'll be here is next Thursday. Do you need it
before then?
PATIENT: Well I was kind of hoping for it before then. Because I mean classes are sort of coming to an end really
soon.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay (108:01). What you can do is call and leave the information if it's not a speciﬁc form
that needs to be ﬁlled out. It's just like a letter that I have to write, just leave the information and who I need to
address it to and what exactly...
PATIENT: I think, well the only person that actually, now that I think about it the only person that I actually need
the note for would be my GSF [ph] for my english class. So is there any chance you could just write like a...
COUNSELOR: I may need to get you to sign some sort of release of authorization. Because you know I can't just let
someone [indiscernible]
PATIENT: Yeah.
