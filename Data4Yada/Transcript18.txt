TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:
______________________________________________________________________________
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
PATIENT: Um, I don't know it's - I sort of feel a little awkward because I've never done this sort of therapy before.
I've never really - I don't know I mean to some degree I'm actually - starting when I ﬁrst tried to get an appointment
here...
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I think I have been trying to avoid thinking about coming as much as possible.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Like what that actually means. And I've sort of been seeing it as just another thing on the list to do,
things that I had to get done.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I don't know, I'm sort of wary on one hand because I just sort of - I don't really know what to expect. Part
of me is sort of coming in and thinking that I sort of come here and expect to somehow, that somehow you're going
to ﬁx me.

COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Then - although I'm pretty sure that's not quite how it works.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I mean, I don't know, that's the extent of my feelings about coming here.
COUNSELOR: And that makes you know perfect sense Ted. A lot of people you know when they have their ﬁrst
you know therapy experiences, that feeling of - those feelings of awkwardness. And then sometimes they fear the
unknown, what is this going to look like? And what am I supposed to do if there is something to do? And you have
a certain image of what treatment is or you have a certain image of what your therapist should be like and sorts of
things. So that you know those little - those feelings are you know pretty natural.
PATIENT: I also, I mean, I also think it's really going to be good for me just to talk to somebody professional who
isn't part of my family or one of my friends. Because I mean I've talked to certain friends, I've talked to my family
sort of. And I don't know, it just seems like speaking to a professional will - they'll have a better understanding of
what I should do. I mean because advice from family and friends can only go so far because ...
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: They don't have any sort of expertise in that sort of area. And also I mean I sort of don't want people like don't want people around me to worry so much.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And so COUNSELOR: About you?
PATIENT: Yeah. I mean I sort of, I would prefer things to be going really well so I don't have any sort of, have to
talk about.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So that people don't worry.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Who are the people that you're concerned about worrying?
PATIENT: Well my parents. My brother. Just some of my closest friends. I mean some of them I feel more
comfortable talking to because I don't think they're going to worry as much.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I think that they'll try to help me obviously but I don't think that they're going to - that's not going to be
the emotions they're feeling.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Do any of them know that you're seeking treatment at this time?
PATIENT: A couple of them.
COUNSELOR: And do you parents know?
PATIENT: It was their idea, actually.
COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.
PATIENT: And my brother knows. I'm not sure if my grandmother knows (2:58). She lives with us and she sort of is
out of the loop sometimes.
COUNSELOR: Okay.

PATIENT: I don't know if my parents have told her.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So...
COUNSELOR: Okay. You're here on campus.
PATIENT: Yeah, I'm here on campus.
COUNSELOR: Where's your family?
PATIENT: They're in Big Rapids.
COUNSELOR: In Big Rapids. Okay. Do you get a chance PATIENT: Big Rapids area.
COUNSELOR: Do you go home often or...?
PATIENT: Um, I don't go home every weekend or anything. I mean I've been home.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And I've been seeing my parents a lot lately though, they've been coming here a lot.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Once or twice a week.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because of just some school issues and trying to keep me on track.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. So let me ask you this, when you say that your parents are the ones who encouraged
you to come, can you tell me how that started or what they were, you know...?
PATIENT: Well, I've just been having a lot of troubles in school lately.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um...
COUNSELOR: What's your major?
PATIENT: I'm undecided right now.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Although I'm thinking right now either Sociology or Philosophy.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Is this your ﬁrst year?
PATIENT: This is my ﬁrst year.
COUNSELOR: First year? Okay. I'm going to take notes if you don't mind.
PATIENT: Yeah, no, that's ﬁne.
COUNSELOR: There's a lot of information I want to hold on to.

PATIENT: Yeah. Um, I mean last semester I wound up failing two of my classes because I just stopped going and
stopped doing the work and didn't turn in the ﬁnal papers. And generally messed up the year. Um, and this semester,
I mean this semester I sort of started falling into the same patterns that sort of got me in trouble last semester.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And basically through a ﬂuke my parents found out.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Because I was in one of my sections for one of the classes that I was sort of skipping with more
regularity COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Um, was the daughter of like a family friend. Not even someone that my parents are that close to.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Which is like, the daughter of an acquaintance of my parents.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And she was in my class and we sort of used to know each other.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And sort of offhand she mentioned to her mom, yeah, I think he must have transferred out of my class or
something.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because I just wasn't showing up.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And her mother and my mother met in the supermarket and her mother said, "Oh, yeah, she says that he
must have transferred out." And my mother of course knew that that wasn't true.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Um, and that's sort of how it got ﬁgured out. And the fact the I mean it sort of - the pattern was starting
over again COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I think that [indiscernible] might be a problem.
COUNSELOR: Okay. And so how did they approach you with this idea of coming here?
PATIENT: Well I mean, initially when they found out about the whole thing they sort of panicked and came and
basically we had a discussion in my tiny dorm room. And they basically just outright said look, do you need
professional help?
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Because after last semester I sort of said look, I'm not very happy where I am.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. What was causing you to be unhappy at that point?

PATIENT: A number of things. Loneliness. The people around me were - like, basically the people around me sort
of were just not the sort of people that I really COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: - connected with on any sort of level.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um, they were the sort of people that I didn't like in middle school. And like when I went to high school
I - there was a completely different group of people there.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Completely different setting.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And these - and it sort of felt like going back to middle school, all the groups sort of COUNSELOR: Cliques.
PATIENT: Clique-ish mentality that I really didn't like.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I just wasn't used to it. And I thought that coming to EMU, to the Honors College, that that would
be like, I'd be around people who were interesting COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: - intelligent people (6:02). And they basically turned out just to be people who could get better grades
and are no more interesting than anybody else.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Um, I mean that, loneliness, and, I can't really explain it.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I just think there's something - because even when things are going well for me sometimes I just get
really down on myself.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Down on yourself in what way?
PATIENT: I'll just feel completely miserable and - almost to the point where I'm incapable of functioning.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Where I'll ﬁnd something wrong with myself.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Um, I'm fairly sure that I'm depressed because I've sort of gone through long phases of being completely
miserable.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: For no real reason.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.

PATIENT: I mean I pretty much, as long as I can remember. I mean I've had phases where I'm sort of happy and sort
of forgetting about what's going on in my life. But - or forgetting about any sort of problems I may be having.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Um, and I just sort of feel, I don't know. I feel happy for a short while but then I sort of go back into
stages where I'm sort of just miserable.
COUNSELOR: Now can you describe for me Ted what that looks like when you're miserable? Like how can you
tell?
PATIENT: Well I - usually when I'm by myself it's really - I just sort of ﬁnd it really easy to sort of take it myself. If
I'm in my room by myself and sort of talking to people online or just in writing, and I just sort of feel - I just, I don't
know. It's just this general sense that I - that I'm just not good enough for the people, that I don't meet my own
expectations.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I'm just not the kind of person that I want to be.
COUNSELOR: You tell yourself these thoughts?
PATIENT: Yeah I just sort of - I don't know if it's coming up with reasons to feel inadequate or if it's just something
that I - I'm probably my harshest critic.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean I also think I just hold people up to a really high standard.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I hold myself up to the highest standard. And I never measure up to the standard that I set for
myself.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And even if I accomplish something that like ought to measure up COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: - it just never feels like it's enough.
COUNSELOR: It's good enough.
PATIENT: Or it's just a momentary feeling of sort of euphoria that, okay, I've accomplished something good. And
then it sort of goes back to normal.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um, I don't know I....
COUNSELOR: Does it affect your sleeping?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Your eating, your...?
PATIENT: Deﬁnitely. Deﬁnitely my sleeping and my eating. I mean COUNSELOR: How so?

PATIENT: Well last year over the course of the year I gained like 15 pounds.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because I was just - and it was just completely unhealthy.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Now, I mean I've gained a little bit more since school started - over the summer I lost a lot of weight.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because I was at home and I started out by working at a Lowe's supply store for a couple months.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that's a lot of heavy lifting.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I'm on my feet all day, I'm running around.
COUNSELOR: It's a lot of exercise.
PATIENT: A lot of exercise. And it was just - that was very good for me.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um, and then after that I was in Croatia where I mean, I think the food's better in terms of just...
COUNSELOR: Healthiness.
PATIENT: Health-wise - like it's, all the foods were greasier but it's got none of the hidden fat (9:02).
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: So you sort of know what it is that you're putting in your mouth.
COUNSELOR: Right, trans fat.
PATIENT: Because it's all just real food instead of like processed stuff. And I lost some weight in Croatia too which
is actually really hard to do because of the whole culture there.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: But when I - I've gained some weight since I came back to school, 5 pounds or so. But like my eating
habits are just completely erratic. There are days where I'll just forget to eat all day. And I'll realize at like 8:00 in
the evening, I'll be like oh my God, I haven't eaten today.
COUNSELOR: Is that because you are....?
PATIENT: I just forget. I just forget. It's not like I'm anorexic or anything or else I wouldn't have gained the weight.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: I would be losing weight.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Or I'll just be constantly eating all day because - one of my biggest problems is that I eat when I'm bored.
COUNSELOR: Okay.

PATIENT: And a lot of the time when I'm not sleeping I'm eating late because I'm just sort of bored because there's
nothing to do.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know my sleep is just awful.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I ah, either I just stay up really late and, even though I know I have to get up early in the morning.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I just can't go to sleep like - I'll be in bed and I'll just lie there watching TV for three hours.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I'll wind up going to sleep at like four in the morning for no reason. Or I'll just fall asleep and
continuously wake up and not be able to stay asleep.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: If it's not one it's the other with me.
COUNSELOR: Does it affect your relationships? I hear the sleeping, I hear the eating issues around that. Does it
affect your relationships?
PATIENT: It puts a strain on, sort of my relationship with my family.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: My parents I mean because we - they always hold me up to a high standard and when I sort of - when my
schoolwork gets affected because of the lack of sleep, I'm exhausted.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: Or I just don't feel like going for some completely arbitrary reason.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I then feel the need, because I feel like I'm letting my parents down COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I then lie to them and tell them oh, yeah, everything's going just ﬁne.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: And that really hurts our relationship.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And I've been doing that sort of thing to them for years now.
COUNSELOR: This is before EMU?
PATIENT: Oh yeah, way before EMU.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Since middle school probably.

COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because I just sort of - like I was always sort of like a forgetful kid.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I always - but I was always really pushed.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Like...
COUNSELOR: Really pushed in respect to what?
PATIENT: Well there was always an expectation, you always get the A.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And a B's not good enough. Um, it was actually kind of strange, when I was younger my parents always
threatened that I would only go to EMU if I - like I would only be able to get into EMU if I didn't work hard. As
though like EMU was sort of like a punishment.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um, they were always saying, "You're going to go to Harvard. You're going to go to Ivy League or
University of Chicago." Or some of those other like really fancy name schools. And EMU is only like a backup. I
mean they obviously didn't tell me when I was younger how good of a school EMU actually is.
COUNSELOR: Actually was. Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And I'm aware that it's a really good school. I mean I don't know if it's necessarily a good ﬁt for me. But
it's a fantastic school. And that was always sort of viewed as a threat.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Until it sort of came out that we - like, in late high school, like they sort of changed their tune when they
sort of ﬁgured out that I wouldn't be getting any money from anywhere else. I got in everywhere I applied.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I just never got any money from anywhere else.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Or at least not anything substantial that I could afford to go there.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Where did you apply?
PATIENT: Loyola University and Washington State (11:59).
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um, and I mean I obviously stayed here. I mean it's fantastic.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: And I got a scholarship here too, so...
COUNSELOR: Whose idea was it for you to come to EMU?
PATIENT: Well it was sort of seen as a backup because with my grades from high school, I mean I didn't have a
perfect 4.0.

COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But with the sort of inﬂation because of AP classes and things like that I wound up with like a 3.79
something.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean if it had been standard 4.0 scale it probably would have been a 3.5 or something.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So there was never really any question of me getting into EMU, you know that was sort of the safety
school of the question of if I would get into the other schools.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And even that wasn't really a question with just my test scores and everything and my essays and all that
stuff.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: But it was just always known that I would apply to EMU and if I didn't get in anywhere else I would go
here.
COUNSELOR: Okay. So was that your parents um, PATIENT: Well, sort of both.
COUNSELOR: - or your assumption or...?
PATIENT: It was sort of both.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean I've always felt like I could get in anywhere at least...
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Or at least I was capable of getting in anywhere. That I was capable of getting in and doing well.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. And was that important to you?
PATIENT: Getting in anywhere?
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Well certainly. I mean I wanted to - I desperately wanted to go to Loyola University.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I got in.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: But I didn't get any money from them which was very hard because my brother went there and he got a
full ride.
COUNSELOR: Is this your older brother PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: - or younger brother?

PATIENT: He's older.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um. I don't know like, the standards have always been really high.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And...
COUNSELOR: Who sets the standards?
PATIENT: Depends who you ask. Because my parents would say that just because I turned out to be so smart that
those are the standards that I have.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: That those are the standards that they applied to me because that's what they saw as my potential.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't really believe that.
COUNSELOR: Okay. What is it that ...?
PATIENT: I think that my brother is involved so...
COUNSELOR: Because your brother went to the Loyola University.
PATIENT: He went to the Loyola University, got a full ride. He, I mean he got one B in high school, all As the rest
of the way. I was sort of - I sort of got a B almost every semester. There were a couple semesters where I got all As
but that was it.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: He was the one who - I mean he always did - was fantastic in school. I mean he would - teachers of mine
who had him, because we went to the same high school.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Teachers - I remember the ﬁrst thing my Biology teacher told me.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: The ﬁrst day I had her class. She said, "Are you Bud Karda's brother?" "Yeah." "He was frighteningly
smart." "Okay."
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I mean that's - and he went to Harvard Economics and I mean now he's in an extremely well-paying job
in Massachusetts. And I mean I really do love my brother. I have no ill will against him I just sort of feel like I'm - I
have to live up to his standards.
COUNSELOR: You're kind of in his shadow.
PATIENT: Deﬁnitely.
COUNSELOR: In a sense. Okay.
PATIENT: I mean I'm sort of the - I mean, my parents and my brother will say that I have more potential than him
but I honestly don't think I have the mindset or the drive to succeed the way that he did.

COUNSELOR: Okay. Why not? What makes you different?
PATIENT: Um, he's a much more driven person. He's sort of always known that - he's sort of always known he was
going to be a economist of some sort. He was always the one who in high school was able to just get his work done
and then go and do whatever (15:00).
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: He was always the one who sort of - I mean he's just that sort of personality where he always ﬁgures
things out, ﬁgures how he can do the most by actually putting out the least amount of effort and sort of - he was
always sort of the...I don't want to say ruthless because that's not the word. Because he's not a ruthless person. He's a
loving person. But I mean he always was the very disciplined, very focused one.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Was he driven?
PATIENT: Yeah I mean, very driven. And I've just never been like that. I mean I really don't care about you know
having the highest paying job.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: It just doesn't matter to me. I don't care about being the - I don't care - I don't really want to be in a great
paying job if I'm not happy in it.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean right now the two things that I could possibly be, just what I'm thinking about COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: - are a social worker or a writer. Neither of which is exceptionally well-paying.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: And particularly because I never would want to do any novel writing.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So from there I mean...
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. So it seems like your values are somewhat different.
PATIENT: Yeah, I'm more concerned about - I'm more concerned about wanting - I think my brother wants more to
succeed and I want more to be happy. In whatever it is that I'm doing. And I sort of see that as a success.
COUNSELOR: I was just about to ask you could happiness be successful? I mean having, reaching happiness.
PATIENT: I also don't really know what my goals are.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Short of a conceptual, okay, I want to be happy.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: I want to be around intelligent people. Well okay but, where does that take me?
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: I don't know what my path in life is going to be. I really just hate thinking about that sort of thing. I hate
thinking about what's my major going to be? What's my job going to be? What am I going to do in life?

COUNSELOR: Have you thought about what about that you hate or...?
PATIENT: Well I just can't - I - it's so unknown to me. It's just, I mean - I don't really want to set, like, set a path for
myself because I am worried that I'm going to be stuck to that path.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And it's sort of - I don't know. I just really don't want to be stuck, like I really don't want to wake up one
morning and realize that I hate my life completely. That I'm really miserable where I am or where I decided to go.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And, like more miserable that I guess I already am.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's really why I'm sort of scared to set any sort of goal for myself.
COUNSELOR: So let me make sure that I'm understanding you right. You're afraid to set goals because you may
have to stick with it and then turn out that the path that you have chosen is one that really doesn't bring that
happiness and that fulﬁllment [indiscernible] and you're stuck.
PATIENT: I mean I'm a little scared that by setting goals that I'd set the wrong ones.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And they're going to be goals that if I fulﬁll them I'm just going to hate myself.
COUNSELOR: Who would be the determining person or determining force to say that this is the wrong goal?
PATIENT: I guess me. I mean I don't know I'd sort of wake up and realize I just hate what I'm doing. I'm in the
wrong business or ﬁeld or whatever (18:00).
COUNSELOR: So if you'd don't do anything you're not going to regret or...
PATIENT: See I don't know how I feel about that either.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because I don't want to wind up - I don't want to wake up one day and realize that I've done absolutely
nothing.
COUNSELOR: Okay. So there's some ambivalence, it sounds like.
PATIENT: Yeah. I mean I want to go somewhere.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: It's just I don't know where to go.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I don't want to make a mistake in choosing where to go.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I know that I want to go somewhere.
COUNSELOR: Go somewhere. But where is that somewhere?
PATIENT: Yeah. I don't want to be that guy who is forty years old living in his parents' basement.

COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: It's not me.
COUNSELOR: So let me ask you this Ted, why social work? Why writing or philosophy?
PATIENT: Philosophy because I love it. I mean there's just - even though I put myself under so much stress when I
do philosophy - I mean especially the week of the exams. That's called hell week.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because every night is - I mean I'll be functioning or barely functioning on maybe - I've had hell weeks
before where I'll have, over the course of the week I'll have slept maybe 6 hours. The whole week.
COUNSELOR: The whole week. Okay.
PATIENT: So, so it's, I mean it's a ton of stress.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: But then that feeling when you start the exam and know the questions.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And you see that the answers are there. And they are staring intently at every move you're going to make.
And before you have that ﬁrst line. I mean I'm a nervous wreck before that moment.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then that moment comes and it's just a feeling of euphoria and everything just sort of drains away.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And I just love that moment. And I also just love philosophical thought.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I mean, there's just nothing like it when using his or her own body and voice and expression and that
someone can convey such meaning and such beauty, that just - it's amazing to me. I'm, I mean I love reading good
philosophical books.
COUNSELOR: What are some of your favorites?
PATIENT: Um, in terms of just the writing? Ah, I think - it's kind of weird, it's hard - in terms of favorite books I
always think of favorite authors because I just, they just - I like reading them, I like the whole notion. But when it
comes to the more fun stuff I think of Hermann Hesse.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Okay.
PATIENT: I mean just the fact that, I mean he wrote Siddhartha.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: It was his masterpiece.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And when you think of that book you think of him. That's the book. Siddhartha is that book.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.

PATIENT: And yet he's on point for so little time. I mean I just want - wish that I could attain that sort of - I mean
that's just greatness right there.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: To have that sort of hold on whatever it is that I'm doing.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: And ah, or I really like sort of everybody's performance in Narcissus and Goldmund" because it's just, I
mean it's sort of a downer but it's also very serious.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's, it's, I mean I just really like the way that whole book is sort of crafted. Because I mean every time I
read it I catch something new.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um, and just the performances that everyone gives and sort of neuroses that they have. And how each
character is very similar but different.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I mean one of the characters reminds me of my grandfather.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I just, I don't know, I just love that book. Um, I loved "Steppenwolf." I just thought that was a
beautiful book.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Hesse was just an amazing author. The Glass Bead Game I thought was just full of fantastic
performances. Again Hesse was amazing.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Um, recently I read Journey to the East.
COUNSELOR: How was that?
PATIENT: That was a fantastic read. I thought it was just well done all around in terms of just the writing. There are
just some fantastic players in that.
COUNSELOR: And why social work? Or what is it about social work?
PATIENT: I really enjoy helping other people.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And I don't even think I'd want to become a social worker.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I went to a Catholic high school.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And so I mean that's really what I know.
COUNSELOR: Okay.

PATIENT: I know the Catholics. I know Catholicism really well in terms of religion and investing [ph] in my
religion.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I think that if I were to go into that, if I were to sort of make that decision.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I mean right now I'm not actually Catholic.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um, I'm - I sort of have this notion that sort of every set religion is at least a little bit wrong. And the
whole notion of having like a dogma, a set set of ideas that you can't ever change is just ridiculous.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Because I mean I don't - I honestly don't - I'm Christian. I believe in God.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: But I don't know that God is there.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't know if God - if there is a God. But if I were to make that decision I think I could sort of
overcome that and say look, okay. You know what? This is beyond me.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And I just sort of have - feel like I almost have a calling to it.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: That I could, if I were to become a Catholic brother, because then I wouldn't have just the responsibilities
of mass and those things [audio gap] help other people.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Not just going to - I mean I would love to be able to go to like a third world country and help the hungry,
sick and poor.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And just how, I mean my senior year of high school in one of my classes my teacher showed me a video
of how he went to basically this orphanage in Russia.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And how these children really had, who were living for a couple years and then dying because of
sickness. And it just, it just, the video that we saw, I mean it was a video with him in it. And it was just so
profoundly moving for me that I mean, I just, I don't know. I just feel a sort of calling to do that sort of thing.
COUNSELOR: What [indiscernible]?
PATIENT: Hmm?
COUNSELOR: I was asking what did it actually stir up for you? [indiscernible].

PATIENT: The ﬁrst thing that I felt was just incredible pity for these children. And I think it also added sort of a
sense of um inadequacy on my part. That here I am sort of being miserable with my own life and yet these kids are
ﬁnding it in - like, I almost feel like if I was in that position I would just be - I would just shut down (23:59). And
these kids are running around laughing and then it cuts to like a still frame photograph of that person saying oh,
look, they died.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Just two weeks after the ﬁlming of this.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And yet these children are so full of happiness and so full of warmth. And I just sort of - I mean that was
one of the feelings, I mean just indignation that nobody's doing anything about it.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I wish I could - was capable of doing something about it. I mean...
COUNSELOR: If you could do something what would you do? [indiscernible]?
PATIENT: I mean I would go and help and be whatever sort of help I could for those children. I mean and that's
where the whole priest thing comes in because if I was a Catholic I think - I feel like I could do that.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because I wouldn't have to worry about having a job. I wouldn't have to worry about money and I mean,
because one of the things of being a Catholic is they have the vow of poverty where they don't have any possessions
of their own. Everything belongs to the community.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And the community provides for the people in the same way that the people work for the community.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. So again it's that whole thing about, you know there's a different value of success.
PATIENT: Exactly.
COUNSELOR: It's not about material things.
PATIENT: Exactly. I don't care about material possessions. I mean yeah, I like having things. That's - it's nice.
COUNSELOR: Can I ask you something Ted? What is your family's world to you for success? I mean to look at
your parents, like what do they do?
PATIENT: My parents don't believe that money is everything.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean, my parents are immigrants. They came from Croatia in '80. And they came here and they were
completely poor.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: My dad didn't speak English when he came here.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: He learned it in a couple months.
COUNSELOR: Okay.

PATIENT: My mother was an English teacher but she, like, she was an English - like she studied English so she
knew the language. She could speak it just ﬁne.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: But she had to go through grad school. And so they know what it is to work hard.
COUNSELOR: Sure. Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: They also know that they can't really provide for me.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The reason why they pushed to work so hard to get a really good job is because they really want me to be
in a position where I can do the things that I want to do.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Where I can be happy.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And they sort of see it as a correlation. If you make a lot of money you'll be with a lot - like, people who
are intelligent enough where they also make a lot of money because that's - the smarter people make the most
money.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Is sort of the theory.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean they know that they're not like other families that can sort of, that sort of have a network of
family.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Where there's the rich uncle, or the grandparents are rich, or the father - they don't have that.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Every - all we have in our family is what my parents have earned.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And what my brother has earned. Like, that's all been on him.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean they've helped where they could but we don't have any sort of fortune.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: I mean my parents are in sort of a higher up bracket in terms of earnings. But I mean they're spending a
lot of money at the same time.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: They're spending it on mortgages, on cars, on tuition, on whatever.
COUNSELOR: Sure.

PATIENT: So they're not going to leave us with a lot.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And they're still paying, I mean they're still paying some debts from when they didn't have - when they
weren't making any money.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. What is it that your father does?
PATIENT: My dad works for GM. He's a manager there and he hates his job.
COUNSELOR: Really.
PATIENT: Yeah. He hates it.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: He comes home and he's just, he just feels so beat up and...he hates dealing with people there. He hates, I
mean he hates the politics of it. He doesn't even really like cars. He said that when he retires he doesn't want to - he
wants to live in a place where he doesn't have to own a car (26:59).
COUNSELOR: Oh, wow, okay.
PATIENT: He just, generally just hates it.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. What is it that you learned from that, from your dad?
PATIENT: Well I know I don't want to be a manager. Um, it's sort of hard for me to reconcile in my mind how he
can work so hard, make so little and then push me to work hard too. When he hates it.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And I know it's - it's sort of an emphasis on trying to be better off than he is. But I mean I don't want to
work for the sake of making money. I want to work to actually do some good.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Whereas working as like a corporate lawyer, I don't see how that does any good to anybody. I mean it
just helps people make money.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't care. I don't want to be a doctor - I mean, I don't want to be some - I don't want to be a doctor
mostly because there's a certain level of responsibility and there's sort of like a threshold where I don't want to cross
that. And a doctor, I mean I don't - I don't want to be working in a job where most of my patients are just dying. Or
in a job where I'm being sued for malpractice for anything, or they can sue me for anything.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I don't want to be in a job where it's not really that important to me. I would never want to be a
plastic surgeon.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Ever.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I also know that I'm not really cut out for the whole science ﬁeld.

PATIENT: I just don't have the...I don't have the inclination towards it because I'm not a numbers guy. And science
is sort of a numbers thing.
COUNSELOR: Okay. So it sounds like you've gone through a process like a weeding out PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Of certain...
PATIENT: I know a lot of things that I don't want to do.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: I don't want to be an economist because they - I mean it - or a political scientist because, I mean for the
same reason actually.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Because both of them sort of look at trends and these things and sort of completely ignore the fact that
people are involved.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: They turn people into statistics, they turn people into numbers.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Into value - like, number values in terms of preferences. That's just not me. You know, like or where the
goals are proﬁt, like in econ. Like when someone's proﬁting, that's the ultimate goal.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I don't - that's not the ultimate goal.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because it's at the expense of somebody else. Or...
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: And I just don't want to do that with my life.
COUNSELOR: So when you came here Ted and you, you know your parents encouraged you to come. You said
earlier how this is something that you thought about and would be a good idea to get some professional help. What
were you envisioning this process to be like? Or what would you want to get out of this? Given your current
situation, your current state, um....
PATIENT: I just sort of want some validation. At least, even, just from myself. I want to be able to tell myself, and
believe it, is more important. Because I've tried to tell myself and say look, it's not that bad.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Don't worry about it. But I want to actually be able to believe it.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That things aren't that bad. That there actually is a reason to keep going with my life.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Have you ever considered at any point harming yourself or taking your life? Have you ever
gotten to the point where you're so miserable that http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:4832/psyc/psyc.object.details.aspx?dorpID=1000122152

PATIENT: Not lately. Um, I - it was pretty bad in high school and then it sort of stopped. Then particularly sort of, I
want to say junior year COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: - where I was sort of feeling really - like I was entertaining thoughts of what would it be like to kill
myself?
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm (30:00).
PATIENT: I even - I even was hurting myself. And very few people knew about it. I mean my parents caught me
once.
COUNSELOR: Hurting yourself how?
PATIENT: Um, I'd just take like a razor blade or a knife and sort of, not for the sake of actually killing myself COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Not - nothing to my wrists. But sort of as a - sort of to feel physical pain maybe.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Maybe it'll distract me from other things.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um, there was actually a time when my entire left forearm was just covered in scar - it was just scars.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I mean it wasn't, it wasn't like deep, anything deep where I was severely bleeding. It was just like cuts
where I would feel it.
COUNSELOR: How did your parents respond to that?
PATIENT: Well my parents, they saw like just a couple cuts that were a couple days old, and they sort of assumed
that, oh, it's only a one time thing. Because they - he must have felt really bad about something and it's only
happening once. It doesn't happen again. And they didn't push me. They didn't pry any further. Um, I think because
they wanted me to be - like because their view of being happy means being rich enough where you can sort of do
whatever you want COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: - with your life, that that's sort of what happiness is.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: They sort of would prefer not to think about is all of this pressure good for me.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Is all of this extremely hard work what I need? What would make me happy?
COUNSELOR: And it sounds like you would want them to think more along those lines.
PATIENT: Yeah. I mean they sort of think in the - sort of in an abstract future. Okay, this - he'll be happy when he
does, when he works really hard.
COUNSELOR: But what about your happiness now?

PATIENT: But along the way I mean I'm not happy. I'm not happy like trying to get to that point. That's not the point
where I want to get to.
COUNSELOR: Okay. When - so outside of the cutting on the forearms, had you ever tried to kill yourself or PATIENT: No, I never actually tried.
COUNSELOR: Did you have plans to?
PATIENT: Plans, no. It was just sort of a thought that kept coming up, like what would happen if I killed myself?
How would I do it? What would the reaction be?
COUNSELOR: When was the last time you had those types of thoughts?
PATIENT: Probably end of junior year, beginning of senior year of high school.
COUNSELOR: High school? So nothing here since college?
PATIENT: No, nothing here. Um, I mean I've been depressed here and just miserable but I - suicide just isn't any
sort of way out.
COUNSELOR: Why not do you think?
PATIENT: Well I never tried it, mostly because I - I mean it's sort of letting everyone down. It's such a form of - it's
such an extreme form of cowardice. Like I'm too afraid to deal with my life that I would kill myself. And that would
be letting everyone down, you know? That would be saying you know I have nothing to live for, but I have friends.
I have my family. That would be letting them down. And, I don't know, it just - I also think - I'm not afraid of death.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: Like I - okay, death. Big deal.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I'm sort of more afraid of a painful death.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Of just suffering.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: And I mean yeah, the cuts to my arms, that was - that was to feel some sort of physical pain but not - I
mean that's not like the kind of enduring, extreme, excruciating - I don't want that. I don't know, I just sort of
wouldn't want a - wouldn't want that sort of a thing. So - and nothing I could think of didn't seem excessively
painful.
COUNSELOR: Okay (33:00).
PATIENT: Um, I mean, cutting my wrists, that would have been horriﬁc, bleeding to death.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
PATIENT: I didn't have any sort of - we're not a gun family. I wouldn't ever get that from them. Poisoning myself
would seem painful, just because it would rip me apart from the inside. Um, jumping off of something high seems
like I would, like the likelihood of not dying instantly COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: - seemed pretty high. So it was like - I wouldn't want that.

PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: But I appreciate your sharing as much as you have. And I would like to you know invite you to
schedule another appointment [indiscernible]. Um, I would deﬁnitely like to invite you to come back again next
week if that's okay with you? Okay you shared a lot of information with me to help me understand your world view
and just, you know what brings you here. And I want to be able to help you as best as I can. Um, you've given me a
detailed picture of how, you know you see your parent and where you ﬁt into that mold. And some of the conﬂict
that you may be experiencing. Okay? Um, so we can schedule another appointment for the same time next week if
that will work out for your schedule.
PATIENT: Okay. I'm pretty sure that that will work out.
COUNSELOR: Okay. And do you have anyone that you talk to, um that you feel close enough to talk to outside of
you know...
PATIENT: Outside of my family?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah. I have a friend.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Because one thing Ted, just to let you know since this is your ﬁrst you know time in therapy,
um, sometimes when you come in here and you talk and some things that you may not have thought about in the
past or you thought that you, you know didn't think too much about as you're talking about sometimes feelings may
come up for you. And so I would deﬁnitely encourage you between our sessions if things become uncomfortable, it
may catch you off guard, whatever the case is, that you deﬁnitely consult or talk with someone that you know you
trust or do something that helps you feel better or whatever the case is. Because sometimes if people haven't gone
through the process they're caught off guard, like what is this about? And so I just want to kind of warn you up front
that that can come up for you. Okay? Next week is the second.
