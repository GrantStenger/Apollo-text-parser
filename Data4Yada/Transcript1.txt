BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
COUNSELOR: First consult with Emma Thompson. Therapist Betty Johnson.
PATIENT: A friend of mine recommended this place.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Now has your friend been here, assessed (ph) before or?
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Every week she goes now.
COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.
PATIENT: So...
COUNSELOR: So she's here, is in therapy, too?
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And she really enjoys it, so, a good experience for her.
COUNSELOR: Well good. And one thing I do want to let you know too, as I'm thinking about it, the work that you do in order for you to get...the
most out of your...your time here, it's important that you have a good ﬁt with the person that you're working with.
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: So I just want to let you know, if at any time you feel like this isn't a good ﬁt, I'm not going to take it personally. We're not bound to
the hip.
PATIENT: Okay. (chuckling)

COUNSELOR: If you think that...someone else would be better suited for you, deﬁnitely let...deﬁnitely let me know, because we have plenty of
people who are...just as qualiﬁed, if not more, and you may have a chemistry with or whatever the case is.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: Okay. So during these next meetings, just kind of get a feel for how this is going for you, and...at any point you can let me know.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: Okay? Well good. So your friend brought you here or...recommended that you come. And as I said, these next three sessions, it will
just be more information gathering and I mean that's where we'll come up with a true plan that...you and I agree to.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: Okay? When you think - as I was looking at your sheet here, when you called in they asked you...some questions about...what you
saw as the issues that you were facing. Can you kind of tell me a little bit about...why you're seeking treatment at this time?
PATIENT: Pretty much ever since I've been young, I've had really like strong insecurity problems.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's even hard for me to describe. It's just like - it's kind of like - it's not like an everyday thing, but I deﬁnitely go through patterns of
feeling just really like, not worthless, but I like ﬁnd myself often, like feeling like I don't really bring a lot to the table like in relationships.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I don't really know why. Because I feel like if you looked at me as an outsider, you would think, 'Why would she think like that?'
And I don't know why I do. And it's just something like deep seated that I don't understand myself.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And if it was just like an equation, it wouldn't add up that way.
COUNSELOR: [It doesn't feel right to you?] (ph)
PATIENT: But it's just like how I feel.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And...
COUNSELOR: Now when you say relationships, are these intimate relationships, familial relationships, friendships?
PATIENT: Mostly in intimate relationships.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I go through like really like initially - well because I have, I have a new boyfriend now and I - that's usually when I'm - when I'm dating
people or - it really brings out the worst in that insecurity in me.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I ﬁnd myself like looking at myself through a microscope and just feeling like not very good about myself. [0:03:03.3]
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And, yeah, I just kind of get tired of feeling that way, and...
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: ...it's just like, I feel like it's probably rooted in something that, in...in my past or something, and I really would like to try to ﬁgure out
what that is, so I can - my mom has like a lot of self-esteem problems, like and a lot of self-worth problems, and like a lot of the women in my
family do actually. So they all, they kind of look at me as - they want to like not have me be how they are when they were in their - when I'm in my
40's they don't want me to be feeling about themselves like the way they do, and I don't want to feel like they do.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I'm trying just to kind of like put an end to it...
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: ...and, you know.
COUNSELOR: You're seized by a pattern and the family's in a cycle of...
PATIENT: Deﬁnitely.

COUNSELOR: ...which (ph) is going to stop you and?
PATIENT: Deﬁnitely.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: My sister went through, talked to people and went through some therapy, and she's a very conﬁdent person...
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: ...and I would like to - I would like to feel how she feels and...
COUNSELOR: How would that look, if you felt like she felt?
PATIENT: She just doesn't let - I ﬁnd like I let a lot of like my physicality really get me down, with like - about - which is like - and I'm...
COUNSELOR: With body image issues or like with physical kind of things?
PATIENT: It's just everything. Like I feel like if I - and I'm not like a vain person, that's the weird thing. I don't look at other people and criticize
them like I do myself. But I look at myself and I'll like, I'll see this ﬂaw and I'll obsess about it. And that one little like ﬂaw will like make me feel
kind of worthless in a way. It's really weird. It's just like I somehow magnify it in my mind.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: And I'm sure nobody's noticing it. And I just want to like, be okay with - I mean I know nobody's perfect and I'm not perfect.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: But I just have this stupid like - I don't know. Just this - I let it just really weight down on my self, like conﬁdence and my self-esteem...
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: ...and it's just generally really stupid. And I know it is, and I can tell myself that, but it just doesn't change how I feel.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: And nobody seems to...people can tell me, "No, that's ﬁne. Nobody notices that." But in my mind, I'll be like - it's the worst thing in the
world and it's just dumb. Then that like spills into other parts, you know?
COUNSELOR: Right. Do you ﬁnd yourself - because this is, I think it's interesting that you say you tell yourself, 'Well this is stupid that
I'm...thinking this way. It's not that bad.' Whatever the case is. And you say - it's interesting that you say that doesn't change the way you feel?
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And as I hear that, even in that context or in those very words, 'this is stupid', it seems like there's still some putting down it's like.
PATIENT: Yeah. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: You know, so why wouldn't...
PATIENT: No kidding. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: ...that help you feel better?
PATIENT: Right. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:05:30.9]...
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Okay. When you say that your mom and women in your family have...experienced the same type of...worthless - feelings of
worthlessness and low self-esteem sorts of things, what have they attributed their low self-esteem or self-worth problems to? Do you know?
PATIENT: I know my mom will blame my dad a lot. But they're not married anymore. But I know - well, she said she was always depressed. That
she remembers like - I don't feel like I'm depressed. I feel like I get waves of just like inadequacy, but I don't ever wake up and feel like...it's just
like a day-by-day thing. [0:06:13.8]
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean I don't get like waves of sadness. But she says she remembers since being a child, not - just feeling just depressed.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But she's really kind of weird, because she'll be - she kind of has this sad, depressed side, but then this other side that's like, 'Screw
everybody. I don't care.' Like, 'I'm doing what I want.' So she kind - she's hard to - just she's hard to pinpoint.
COUNSELOR: Okay.

PATIENT: Well she was just actually - they thought she was depressed for all of these years, and now they think they've diagnosed her as bipolar.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: She deﬁnitely has all the, a lot of the traits. I don't feel like - her and I are very different people, so that's - I just see her as like a sad
person, who has like isolated a lot of people, who doesn't have a lot of people in her life, and I don't want that to happen, and my aunt is kind of the
same way.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.
PATIENT: They had like a really good childhood, parents who provided like everything for them, but they were just not satisﬁed. I mean their
father like was providing for them until the day he died, and they're just - nothing has ever been able to satisfy them, and in that regard, I am
different. So...
COUNSELOR: Okay. Different in what sense?
PATIENT: They're just like very money oriented and very - they don't - they don't seem to think they have to work for things. They don't - they
kind of have like a sense of entitlement I guess.
COUNSELOR: Okay. And you're different how?
PATIENT: Well my parents never had money. I never was really given much by them. And I've always pretty much just taken care of myself, and I
don't really get like - I don't expect them to do things for me.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So, just kind of just different along those lines.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. You mentioned you have a sister?
PATIENT: Yes. I have two sisters and two brothers.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Do you want to tell me a little bit about them?
PATIENT: Well, my older sister is actually getting her Ph.D. in - like I think it would be - it's like a guidance counselor.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: School, education. And then, and she's in the Navy and she - yeah, she received help when she was in the Navy. And...
COUNSELOR: Like treatment, helped by them?
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And she's just very - she's like she's a happy person. She was depressed when she was in the Navy, but - yeah, she's just pretty easy
going. Well actually she's kind of intense. She's like an intense but easy going, but a hard worker. My brother is the next in line. He's getting ready
to go to the Marines. And he, when he was younger, when my parents were getting divorced, my parents were like - it was like a really horrible,
bad divorce. And my mom like immediately started seeing a married man, who was like emotionally abusive. And when my brother was like ﬁve,
they put, sent him to a psychologist, because he wanted to hurt himself.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So, the state, well not the state, the judge took my brother away and gave him custody, gave my dad custody.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So, my brother kind of has, my brother has like a lot of - he doesn't talk to my mom and he - he just never really seemed to ever get
passed that, and therefore, has kind of like been stunted emotionally. [0:09:22.4]
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: And he has like a really hard time holding down jobs and like going to school, so that's why he's trying to do the Marine thing.
COUNSELOR: Okay. And how old is he?
PATIENT: Twenty-one.
COUNSELOR: And your other sister?
PATIENT: Twenty - she'll be 26.
COUNSELOR: Okay. And what's her name?
PATIENT: Dorothy.

COUNSELOR: Dorothy. So, Dorothy...
PATIENT: Dave.

COUNSELOR: Okay. And what is he in school for?
PATIENT: Physical therapy. He's an Instructor.
COUNSELOR: Oh!
PATIENT: He's really a very - he's like very, very driven, I think.
COUNSELOR: Okay.

COUNSELOR: Oh, wow!
PATIENT: Yeah. He's in Greece training with a like the best ranked students in the world this summer.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So he's like really like on the - he's graduating in two years. He's just very like work, work, work, work, work.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then the youngest is my half sister, Bella, and she's 15, and she was my dad and my - she's my dad and my stepmom's child, so she's very close to my parents.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I have stepbrothers too, but I don't really like talk to them or anything like that, so.
COUNSELOR: And these are your dad's?
PATIENT: Stepdad's kids.
COUNSELOR: Stepdad's kids.
PATIENT: So, he has three sons and a daughter.
COUNSELOR: Okay. So I'm having to get some information to kind of get a clearer picture of how this...how the family - who is in the family,
how...so we'll do that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: What, how old were you when your parents got divorced? [I don't think you told me.] (ph)
PATIENT: Nine?
COUNSELOR: Nine? Okay. Okay. Where does the interest in the...in the Navy and the Marines, where does that come from? Is that something that
your siblings got from other family members or just something that they... [overlapping voices at 0:11:15.4]...
PATIENT: Just kind of something that my sister has got into - was in ROTC when she was at university.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And was just really pretty hardcore about it. And then, she actually had a - she was - she got in - she was medically boarded, but while
she was there, we think somebody - we think somebody like slipped her a lot of date-rape drugs.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And so she was pretty - all of the pieces coming together there, it appears she was raped, so that's when she really sought counseling and
then she got out of the Navy. So, she just was - [never been bothered] (ph) in ROTC and...
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And my brother is just going because - we had a college fund from my grandparents and he like basically blew it, at like a couple of
different schools.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So now he's kind of like - this is like his last like try.

COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. So I'll get more information about your siblings and - do you, are you close to any of them? [overlapping voices at
0:12:07.6]...
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, I'm close with all my siblings.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The girls and the boys.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: We're very close.
COUNSELOR: How, how will you describe that closeness? Like if I was an outsider looking in, how could I tell you were really close with them?
[0:12:19.6]
PATIENT: We all communicate a lot. We're all like very affectionate with each other. We just joke and laugh a lot.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean, we fought a lot when we were young, but I think that's because we were like left home alone. Well like basically, we're close I
think because our parents aren't very like - we kind of just like bonded out of like desperation.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: I mean, growing up...
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: ...we were like - well like the youngest is my half sister, so she had a different childhood experience than the lot of us did.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: But I'd say the four of us, the natural, like 100 percent...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: ...siblings, were like very tight.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And, yeah, I think that was more like a coping mechanism.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: So.
COUNSELOR: Okay. And it's good that you can probably - you can see that for yourself.
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: Wow! And so that shows a strength, and just as I'm sitting here talking to you and listening to you, one of the things that you
mentioned earlier on, is that there may have been some...some deep seated reason...
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...why you may struggle with insecurity and has that as a challenge. And some people can't identify that.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: You know, they think it's about the here and now or whatever the case is. And just for you to say, I think, could - it has to be
something underneath this, and I want to explore it and try and ﬁgure it out.
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: That's deﬁnitely a strength Emma.
PATIENT: And that's good?
COUNSELOR: [nonverbal 'yes'] And that...helps in treatment, when you want to be curious about yourself and curious about how the past is
affecting your present...
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: ...so you can have a different future.
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']

PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I had just started working there and then I moved out, like a couple of months later.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Was that a good break up, a bad break up or?
PATIENT: It was a good break up for the most - I mean, I don't think he wanted it to happen, but I - we probably should've broken up like in a
couple of years. We were together for about ﬁve years.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: We probably should've broken up after three.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Why do you say that?
PATIENT: I think we just were together out of comfort.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then he cheated on me with a girl he worked with one day, and I was - I broke up with him, and then I stayed. And then basically I
told him what I needed out of the relationship, and then he, he just couldn't give it to me. And he lied to me like a lot about other - like he just - I
really didn't trust him anymore, so...I just ended it and dealt.
COUNSELOR: Okay. [silence from 0:16:47.8 to 0:16:55.6] [And I judge you're currently dating now?] (ph)

PATIENT: We just kind of do our own thing and - we're friends though, but we like respect each other's space and each other's property and each
other's time. And we don't like...we're very like easy to live with each other.
COUNSELOR: Does he know that you're seeking, that you're seeking therapy? Can you guys talk on that level or?
PATIENT: Actually, we - I did tell him. I did tell him, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Okay. And what was his reaction to all this? [0:18:24.6]
PATIENT: He says it's probably good to try to ﬁgure out why I feel the way I do, because he doesn't understand it and...
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But generally what most people say, they just think on the outside that they think that I'm like - have it together and that...
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: ...I'm like a happy-go-lucky person. That is true to a certain extent, but I mean I don't share - I don't share those thoughts with people.
(chuckling)
COUNSELOR: [Why share? I know.] (ph)
PATIENT: Or I share...with very few people and that's just like my sister, she'll be the one that I call - I'll call when I'm kind of upset, and...
COUNSELOR: This is your sister Dorothy?
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So.

PATIENT: I do actually.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I do, I mean, I know who I can go to.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah, for the most part, probably actually would just be Dorothy. She's really the only person I would - my current boyfriend, we haven't
been going out that long and he knows, he knows I'm doing this...
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: ...and he like thinks it's the right thing to do, because he doesn't come from like a varied background like I do, like family wise, and...
COUNSELOR: You said, varied?
PATIENT: Yeah. I was just like...
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: ...it was like a lot - just like a lot of stuff happened growing up and...
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: ...he doesn't really have his share - he can't really share those experiences.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I kind of feel like, this is somebody I'm serious about and if I - I feel like - I feel like it's like a more responsible thing to do, is try
to - like I don't want anything to interfere with how I - I don't need my own insecurities coming to mean, just like relationship path, so.
COUNSELOR: Sure. In this though that maybe you can have - let me ask you before I say that, how can you tell this is a good relationship?
PATIENT: We'll - well - well we have like a good friendship. And we just - I - it's just like a closeness that I've never experienced, not even with
my boyfriend, and basically, everything I asked my boyfriend at the time, he would give me. I don't have to ask this person to do.
COUNSELOR: Okay. He just does it...
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: ...on his own volition?

COUNSELOR: This is your ﬁrst experience?
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: Okay. How do you feel about therapy, in general?
PATIENT: I think it's a positive thing.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't feel like - most people who I've talked to about it will just joke around and say like, "Well, don't let them put you on any drugs."
And I'm like, "Well it's not really like that." (both chuckling) Like...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: ...I don't think it's - I mean it's clear I don't need drugs.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I think it will be a positive experience. I mean that somebody - I was always very open with my friends growing up...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: ...and, but it's - they know me, and it's nice like a third-party perspective...
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: ...somebody who has heard - who is trained in this ﬁeld, to like be able to look at me somewhat objectively, which I would, which I
think might help.
COUNSELOR: Sure. Okay. When you think about - because one question that I'd simply like to ask is, why therapy now? You know, because you
talk about the issues of insecurity, didn't just start now, it's something that you can remember...having growing up as a young girl. So why now?
PATIENT: I think honestly it is my current relationship. I mean, I don't - I ﬁnd myself at certain points, when we really ﬁrst started dating, just
really kind of looking at him, thinking, 'Wow. He's really wonderful.' And, 'Why does he like me?' And it wouldn't matter how many times he
would tell me why.

COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It - I don't - it doesn't like sink into my head. And that, I can see that really causing a problem...
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: ...like my own - I can see myself like putting something between us.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [And I would really make that happen] (ph), based on - I mean he's done nothing but like say totally wonderful things, and for some
reason, to me, that's just like not realistic.
COUNSELOR: Okay. So it's - and that this awakening experience you're having in this really good relationship, 'I don't want...to bring out this
other stuff into it that will...'
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: '...interfere or cause it to go badly.' Well, you know?
PATIENT: Yeah. And just, I don't want to be 40 and upset about - I feel like I don't want to be like my mom. I don't want to be sad and isolated
when I'm older. [silence from 0:23:41.0 to 0:23:51.6]
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I mean there are days when I can see that happening, but you know...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: ...it's not an all the time thing, but there are days when I'm - I can see that. I'm like, 'There's my future.' And I really can't stand that idea,
so.
COUNSELOR: And how often does that come up for you?
PATIENT: Probably, a few days every month or so.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Is there anything typically that's usually going on? I mean have you noticed a pattern like or something?
PATIENT: (chuckling) I've been kind of thinking lately, like, 'Is it kind of PMS? I don't know.' (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Okay. Well that's really something to think about, right?
PATIENT: It is.
COUNSELOR: Because, you know...
PATIENT: It is. Well like - it's just like - I don't know. [0:24:32.4]
COUNSELOR: Okay. Well just something to think about.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You know, if you've noticed a pattern. Like sometimes, I mean, we deal with a lot of students here, and they typically...they ﬁnd after we do some work and kind of piece things together, it seems like around ﬁnals is when they feel the most anxious or the most...stressed or
whatever the case is. Whereas they weren't able to make that connection before. Or maybe it's a signiﬁcant...anniversary in their life...a parent
passed away or...was when they...sometimes make transitions in their life. When they came to school or when they moved to high school they
remembered experiencing the same, the same type of symptoms or...
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: ...issues. So just kind of...play around with that in your mind, because there typically something that's usually...going on that may
trigger these feelings of insecurities more so during other times of your life or the month or, you know?
PATIENT: Yeah. Well one thing recently was, like lately I've been waking - I've been having like really like dehydrated skin.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I went to, I ﬁnally went - I've been dealing with that for about a year. And I went to an dermatologist lately and they diagnosed me
with like severe dry skin.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And now I'm on just all these creams and stuff. And like those days when my skin is like, to me, like weird looking or just like red and
unattractive, it makes me feel like, like this big, just like...
COUNSELOR: Sure.

PATIENT: ...and like it reminds me of like when I was like a teenager and I had really bad acne and I like didn't want people looking at me, and it
like made me not want to like go out. And it really like, kind of like paralyzes me in a way.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: And then it really brings out like all types of insecurities.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It just makes me feel like almost, not like helpless or, almost like hopeless in a way...
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: ...like I don't want to move forward being like this. But I'm - and then I'll try to tell myself, 'Well it's just like something physical and
probably nobody notices it and...' You know what I mean? Or, but I just feel like it cripples me.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: It's really weird.
COUNSELOR: Okay. And how often does that happen?
PATIENT: Like any time there's like something that just makes me feel insecure about the way I look. Like some days, when I haven't like
exercised enough and I'm like feeling fat or something, I get really like down on myself or occasionally I'll get like a cold sore on my lip and I like
get really down on myself and I don't want anybody looking at me. It's just like, 'Why do I hold so much stock in what people think about how I
look?'
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Like I know I have more to offer than that, and - but it's just, the thing that's weird is I'm not a vain person. I don't like I don't judge
other people that way.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I just judge myself that way, like really harshly.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And obviously there's, I can see more than so little in how you look, I mean, I know all that.
COUNSELOR: Have you had any issues with - when you talk about body issues, as far as we have, are there times like when you've had any issues
in the past with eating?
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: Like?
PATIENT: When I ﬁrst got to college I, I like stopped eating like fat. I would only have like - I can't - I would only have like 20 grams of fat a day
and I was eating like cereal all the time. And I kind of started like exercising obsessively and I dropped like 20 pounds, and people were kind of
worried about me. And then, and then I just, I did, I totally relaxed about that. But I mean, to this day, I do count calories. I mean I give myself, I'll
eat like 2,000 calories... [0:27:46.4]
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: ...it's not like I'm like making myself eat 1,200. But I - that's deﬁnitely like one aspect of my life where I like to be in control of it.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It makes me feel like more - if feels - I feel like better about myself like controlling that.
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: And like the days when I like, I'm under 2,000 calories, it makes me feel good.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.
PATIENT: So it's like I under - the weird thing is, is like I know that, that's not like good.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But, because I do, it is kind of like a preoccupation in a way.
COUNSELOR: Okay. So you become overly focused on it and concerned about it and... [overlapping voices at 0:28:17.0]
PATIENT: Yeah, because the days I've eaten well and exercised, I feel better. And like then the days when I didn't have time to exercise I feel
worse.

COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So it's like, it's weird.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Have you had any issues around like anorexia or bulimia?
PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't have enough willpower to be anorexic. (both chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I could never just not eat.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I'd never make myself throw up.
COUNSELOR: When you talk about some of the - you mentioned... [inaudible at 0:28:52.7] ...you'd mentioned, some days when you'd like have
the severe dry skin or when other things have happened, it's like you may feel like you may not want to go on, can you tell me a little bit more
about that?
PATIENT: I just kind of like get like on a negative spiral. It's not like I would ever want to hurt myself or anything, but I have had thoughts. I've
had thoughts where I'm like - it's going to make it sound - I think that saying this is going to make it sound worse than I really feel, but some days I
think, for like a ﬂeeting moment, sometimes it just seems like things would be easier if I wasn't alive.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But, at the same time, I'm not willing to do anything about that. I would never do anything about that. And I, when I think that way for a
split second, I will immediately think of something, try to make myself think of something more positive.
COUNSELOR: Well, kind of like what?
PATIENT: Just like all the things in my life that are good, that I would want to be, that I'm happy about, because there's plenty of them.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I just...
COUNSELOR: So for example, like what kind of... [overlapping voices at 0:29:54.7]
PATIENT: Like my friends and my family.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Just like a nice day, small, like little things. I try to look at like little things all the time to be happy about.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I just sometimes - I don't know.
COUNSELOR: Well when was the last time you had ﬂeeting thoughts in that manner?
PATIENT: Probably a couple of weeks ago.
COUNSELOR: Okay. What was going on a couple of weeks ago?
PATIENT: I went to the doctor about my skin and they vaguely just said that I don't really produce any oils and I probably never will. And that I
probably will have to just keep doing what I'm doing with all the treatments. And that I probably will never like, my skin probably will always be
this way, and... [audio blip at 0:30:36.3 to 0:30:43.9] ...just kind of like that's just like a really, in my mind, it just felt like a really big hurdle that I
was going to have to like take with me. [0:30:49.8]
COUNSELOR: And like how so?
PATIENT: Just some issue that's always going to be there, like this one feeling about the way I look that I'm always going to have now.
COUNSELOR: Okay. So it was more so about the dry skin?
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: What about this notion of not ever being able to produce those oils and having to use treatments daily, would that affect you in any
way or?
PATIENT: No, not really.

COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I guess I never really thought about that.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Okay. And so these thoughts that they're ﬂeeting. Well, you say that you would never act out on anything and give yourself some
positive spin on what you're thinking.
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: You use some type of counter as a response, what's good going on in your life or with people that you have and that you know.
Have you ever attempted any type of suicide or...
PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: ...so far?
PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: My mom, my mom has.
COUNSELOR: Your mom has?
PATIENT: And it just seemed - that is enough to make me never, ever do that to anybody in my life or myself.
COUNSELOR: Okay. So it's for you, it's a part of not hurting other people by making that gesture or doing that?
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: What happened with your mom, if you don't mind telling me?
PATIENT: Well it's - when we were - I guess her mother used to threaten to do it. I remember being like eight or nine and my mom saying to me,
"If you guys ever threaten to kill yourselves you'd better do it, because I'm not going to live with you guys holding this type of thing over my
head." Like when my sister and I were like nine and ten or maybe Dorothy was 11 by then. And then about three years ago - no, longer than that,
like seven years ago, she tried to kill herself, because - I don't even know what was going on. What was going on? Oh, my stepdad had physically
harmed my older sister and we got my mom like out of the house. Because mom always said if like he ever physically harmed us she would leave
him. And he did, he like beat my sister against the wall. And my mom - so we like, my grandpa and all of us, like got all her valuables out and my
grandpa like bought her a house and we put her in this house, and she was just like upset and tried to hurt herself. So she was put in like a mental
hospital or something like, whatever you would call it...
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: ...for like a week or so.
COUNSELOR: This was seven years ago?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think about that.
COUNSELOR: How did that impact you Emma?
PATIENT: It kind of made me more angry than anything. I've always been kind of frustrated with her. I feel like she's been given a lot of chances in
life and I feel like she's always had a lot of people trying to help her with all of her issues. And I feel like she just is a very selﬁsh person and she
never - it just always seems like she's never thinking about other people. [0:33:53.0]
COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.
PATIENT: So it really kind of made me mad. I mean obviously it made me sad, but more than anything I think it really made me really angry.
COUNSELOR: So would you say that the, if I'm hearing correctly, that was a selﬁsh act?
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. Has anyone else in your family ever attempted suicide or...
PATIENT: My aunt.
COUNSELOR: ...ever completed suicide?
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: Okay.

PATIENT: My aunt and my little cousin, who was 17, was - probably after Christy was born too, so probably like 17 years ago.
COUNSELOR: Were you around for that or?
PATIENT: I didn't, wasn't really aware of it because I was like ten or something.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I know, she told me now, like she told me like a couple of years ago.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Let me see now I gave you that and this... [inaudible at 0:34:48.8]... Have you ever used any drugs or alcohol or?
PATIENT: Marijuana.
COUNSELOR: Marijuana?
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']
COUNSELOR: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about your marijuana use?
PATIENT: Well, (big sigh) (chuckling) when I was in college, up until about a year ago actually, I got into it as an everyday smoker.
COUNSELOR: Okay. So that was about how many years ago?
PATIENT: About a year ago.
COUNSELOR: Okay. About how much would you smoke a day?
PATIENT: Oh, like a joint.
COUNSELOR: Would this be by yourself, with others?
PATIENT: Generally alone but...I would try to get other people to do it with me (chuckling) but...
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: ...I mean, sometimes they would but, I'd generally like to do it when I was alone.
COUNSELOR: Okay. And you said up until a year ago, what happened up until a year ago that you...?
PATIENT: Ah, I just go tired of it. Just kind of like just didn't really like do - just kind of like feel like I kind of outgrew it in a way.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Just kind of lost interest.
COUNSELOR: How did marijuana use affect you, like with - how did it affect your relationships or you know?
PATIENT: I mean I obviously used it as an escape. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I would just kind of want to relax and like tune out and - I never like, I would never like smoke it and then go to class. It was always like
at the end of the day when I had nothing else to do...
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: ...and I'd gotten all the things I needed to do done that day. And then I would just kind of use it to unwind or...that's just kind of how I
would do it. Or like on the weekends in like a social situation, that kind of thing.
COUNSELOR: Well what kind of person were you like, I mean when you'd smoke pot?
PATIENT: Just really laid back.
COUNSELOR: Okay. [0:36:53.9]
PATIENT: And so like you'd be really relaxed, just easy going.
COUNSELOR: Okay. [inaudible]...
PATIENT: It seems like I used - generally it seemed like I used it as more of a stress reliever.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Did anybody ever say that you had a problem with it or...

PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: ...encourage you to get help with it or?
PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It was always something that I could stop at any time.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.
PATIENT: It never felt like it was like - it never felt like it was anything I had to have or had to do. It was always just like a matter of choice and...if
I didn't want to, I wouldn't or if I couldn't, because I was like visiting family or whatever, it just was no big deal.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Did anyone in your family know you were using?
PATIENT: Pretty much everybody knows now. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: How did they ﬁnd out?
PATIENT: My sister told them because I was taking some to my aunt...
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: ...and she got scared that I was, I was - for a while I was taking her like pretty much large, large amounts. Not like large but I mean,
enough where if like I got pulled over, I would probably go to jail.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So, my sister was angry with my aunt, for like putting me in that type of jeopardy, and she told my mother, and then...understandable.
Looking back on it, that was really stupid of me and that would really suck if that would've happened. I mean that is actually like a big part of why
I stopped. I mean I wanted to stop but again, I'm like, 'I'm 23 years old and I don't need to be going to jail. I have a - I am a professional and I have
a life and I don't really need...'
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: '...to be risking something for something so stupid.' So, I think I just kind of grew out of it.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Well that's a very mature thing to think about...this...
PATIENT: That would be horribly embarrassing if I had a joint in my car and I called into work and was like, 'Sorry, I'm in jail.'
COUNSELOR: Right, yeah.
PATIENT: I mean that would be horrible. So, it would ruin my career.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: No. On any medication?
PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: Okay. So...
PATIENT: And that's the only drug I've ever done.
COUNSELOR: Okay, is marijuana?
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Alcohol, have you...?
PATIENT: When I was in high school I kind of drank a lot.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But, and when I got to college, I mean, once in a while.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Like now, maybe like once a week I'll have like a couple of glasses of wine, like on Friday or a Saturday night...
COUNSELOR: Okay.

PATIENT: ...but nothing like - I don't keep alcohol in my house or anything like that on a regular basis. [silence from 0:39:17.0 to 0:39:32.7]
COUNSELOR: Okay. I think this time goes past so...
PATIENT: Yeah, it does. (chuckling)
COUNSELOR: ...quickly, it goes really quickly. [And lets see, okay, all right.] (ph) Well another thing I will just ask, are there any signiﬁcant
anniversaries or signiﬁcant losses that I need to know about?
PATIENT: My grandpa died, who I was very close with, it will be three years in September. I believe it was the 28th. [0:40:04.3]
COUNSELOR: How do you typically feel around the anniversary of his death?
PATIENT: Last year, I don't know if it was just because it was the ﬁrst year, I didn't really feel very much of anything.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Just kind of...
COUNSELOR: Sad (ph)?
PATIENT: Yeah. But this year, I don't know. I don't know how I'll feel.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. Any other signiﬁcant losses or anniversaries?
PATIENT: [nonverbal 'no']

your dad and we can talk a little about that...
